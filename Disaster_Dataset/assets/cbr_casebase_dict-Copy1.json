On 24 January 2020, the Ministry of Health and Population declared a national measles epidemic.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"A response plan and a resource mobilization strategy were developed with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and non-governmental organizations. The main action adopted in the response plan consisted of a national vaccination campaign targeting 2.65 million children aged between 6 months and 10 years, with an emphasis on the children aged 6 months up to 5 years, given their particular vulnerability. Due to the limited availability of vaccines and medical equipment, a difficulty which was further amplified by COVID-19, the vaccination campaign was planned in two phases: a first phase in February and March covered the 13 most affected health districts and a second phase followed in August in the remaining 22 health districts. After an initial phase between January and March, where measles cases continued to increase, a decrease was observed in the 13 health districts that had already implemented the immunization campaign. In September, a considerable drop in suspected cases was noted with less than 50 new infections per week in the last two weeks of the month.\",\n        \"affected_countries\": [\"Central African Republic\"],\n        \"sources\": [\"OCHA\", \"WHO\", \"UNICEF\"],\n        \"language\": \"English\"\n    }\n}", "https://reliefweb.int/disaster/wf-2009-000162-grc": "{\n    \"https://reliefweb.int/disaster/wf-2009-000162-grc\": {\n        \"disaster_title\": \"Greece: Forest Fire - Aug 2009\",\n        \"disaster_type\": [\"Forest Fire\"],\n        \"date\": \"August 2009\",\n        \"disaster_description\": \"No description\",\n        \"interventions\": \"No specific interventions mentioned.\",\n        \"affected_countries\": [\"Greece\"],\n        \"sources\": [\"ReliefWeb\"],\n        \"language\": \"English\"\n    }\n}", "https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-1997-0530": "{\n    \"https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-1997-0530\": {\n        \"disaster_title\": \"Peru: Floods - Dec 1997\",\n        \"disaster_type\": [\"Flood\"],\n        \"date\": \"December 1997\",\n        \"disaster_description\": \"No description\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Not specified\",\n        \"affected_countries\": [\"Peru\"],\n        \"sources\": [\"ReliefWeb\"],\n        \"language\": \"English\"\n    }\n}", "https://reliefweb.int/taxonomy/term/5044": "{\n    \"https://reliefweb.int/taxonomy/term/5044\": {\n        \"disaster_title\": \"Brazil: Floods - Jun 1992\",\n        \"disaster_type\": [\"Flood\"],\n        \"date\": \"June 1992\",\n        \"disaster_description\": \"No description\",\n        \"interventions\": \"No specific interventions mentioned.\",\n        \"affected_countries\": [\"Brazil\"],\n        \"sources\": [\"ReliefWeb\"],\n        \"language\": \"English\"\n    }\n}", "https://reliefweb.int/disaster/ls-2015-000135-lka": "{\n    \"https://reliefweb.int/disaster/ls-2015-000135-lka\": {\n        \"disaster_title\": \"Sri Lanka: Floods and Landslides - Sep 2015\",\n        \"disaster_type\": [\"Flood\", \"Landslide\"],\n        \"date\": \"2015-09\",\n        \"disaster_description\": \"Continuous heavy rain since mid-September 2015 in the southern regions resulted in floods and landslides, causing eight deaths and nine injuries.

He said the base had \u201ccaught fire due to neighbouring farmers clearing farming land by setting it alight, leading to the explosion\u201d. The president has appealed for international aid.

Floods and a landslide event occurred on 30 August in Darchula District (Sudurpashchim Province, far western Nepal), leading to fatalities. According to the Nepal National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (DRR) and media reports, three people died and two are missing. Several houses, buildings, two hydropower plants and five bridges have been damaged or destroyed. The monsoon rains that began in the last week of June have triggered flooding and landslides in many parts of the country, affecting around 10,000 families in 56 out of the country\u2019s 77 districts. On 26 August, rainfall intensified for at least four consecutive days, with many rivers crossing warning levels, causing widespread inundation in many parts of the southern plains and reported incidents of landslides in the hilly region. As a result of this incessant rainfall, 11 districts (Myagdi, Rupandehi, Dang, Darchula, Sindhuli, Nawalparasi East, Nawalparasi West, Kanchanpur, Kailali, Udayapur and Mahottari) and 4,899 families were affected, including 2,129 who were temporarily displaced. In addition, government authorities have reported seven deaths and one missing person in recent days (as of 31 August 2021), while further assessment processes are underway. Many houses have been destroyed by the landslides and floods in specific pocket areas of several districts, and many displaced families are staying with relatives, while others have sought refuge in nearby schools and other temporary shelters. Similarly, displaced families have lost access to water points and sanitation facilities, increasing the risk of health problems, water-borne diseases, and the spread of COVID-19 infection in the community. With 35,591 active cases in the country, there is a high chance of COVID-19 transmission among people affected by the flood and landslide (daily infection rate is still around 20 per cent) either among those staying in home isolation or \u2013 most importantly \u2013 among those staying in evacuation centres. Severe weather including heavy rain and thunderstorms continues to affect parts of Nepal, causing floods and landslides and leading to casualties.

More than ten individuals have been injured and one person is missing in Lumbini Province. Unusually heavy rainfall in a short period of time on September 6 has led to flooding in the city of Kathmandu, inundating more than 382 houses and several roads, local marketplaces, and parks. About 105 mm of rainfall was recorded in just three hours in Kathmandu. At least 138 people have been rescued by security forces. The most affected households are those living in informal settlements in low-lying areas of the city. The Bagmati River that flows through the city was at danger level, but the water level has receded. This follows heavy rainfall and floods in several areas across the Tarai Valley the previous week, which resulted in nine deaths, four missing people, five injured, and 756 people evacuated, with at least 42 houses completely damaged. Flash floods, floods and landslides caused by heavy rain have been affecting different parts of Nepal, leading to casualties. According to the latest report by NDRRMA, there are 32 dead and 43 missing people. Several Districts in Sudurpaschim Province (western Nepal) have been heavily affected, including Kanchanpur District, where the overflow of Mahakali River flooded several settlements, displacing more than 2,600 people. There has been extensive damage of the paddy crops which were ready to be harvested. Highways have been blocked by landslides in many places of the country. In the eastern parts of the country, two airports operations have been disrupted. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, however rescue efforts are hindered by severe weather conditions and the remoteness of the affected areas. In Nepal, based on the last Disaster Risk Reduction Portal (DRRP), there are 88 fatalities, 30 people still missing and 10 injured people across several Districts. On 21 October, the Prime Minister along with other ministers visited to the affected districts in the western region of the country. The local authorities provide the government relief assistance, that was announced on 20 October, directly to the affected households. Unseasonal heavy rains since 17 October brought floods and landslides across the country and have killed over 100 people. Heavy rains and floods have reportedly damaged rice paddy crops worth more than US$50 million. Roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure were also damaged. The impact of the floods, combined with existing livelihood setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a devastating impact on many communities in Nepal in the coming months. The impact of evacuations, collective sheltering, and rescue operations on COVID-19 transmission rates will be monitored over the coming weeks. According to the data of the Ministry of Home Affairs, between June to 27 October 2021, 673 people have lost their lives, 69 people are missing and 181 people are injured due to the water-induced disaster. Beyond the shelter and displacement related needs, the main impact for affected householders is on their livelihoods since this unforeseen recent rainfall happened during the end of the festival time and as the harvesting of crops was about to start. In some areas, between 60 to 80 per cent of the harvest was lost as per government preliminary data. According to a WFP 72h assessment report released on 28 October, it is estimated that the food security status of 77,635 people is significantly affected as a result of the flooding, of which 63,897 people, or 11,716 households, need immediate assistance.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Search and rescue works are predominantly being carried out by federal government agencies.

Earlier this year, an EVD outbreak affected North Kivu Province which was declared over on 3 May 2021. Ebola vaccination began today in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s North Kivu Province where a case was confirmed on 8 October. People at high risk, including contacts of the confirmed case and first responders will receive the doses as the health authorities move to curb the spread of the virus. A total of five cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been confirmed in North Kivu province since 8 October 2021. Three people died and all cases are from a community in the Beni health zone. Ten patients are hospitalised, including two confirmed and eight suspected cases. 386 contacts have been established so far, with 322 followed in the last 24 hours and 140 people have been vaccinated so far. The index case, diagnosed on 8 October and deceased in a health facility, had three family members who died in September, but they were not investigated for Ebola. The detected Ebola strain is 96% similar to the one from the 10th EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2018-20). As of 24 October, six cases have been confirmed, the last case was reported on 22 October. All the cases have been from the Health Area of Butsili, Beni Health Zone: 4 people have died, and 2 people are currently in isolation at the temporary Ebola Treatment Center in the General Reference Hospital in Beni. Preliminary sequencing conducted indicates that this outbreak is likely linked to the 2018-2020 Nord Kivu/Ituri Ebola outbreak and was initiated by transmission from a persistently infected survivor or a survivor who experienced relapse. As of 31 October 2021, eight cases (5 female and 3 male) have been confirmed, the last case reported on 30 October 2021. Three Health Areas Butsili, Ngilinga, and Bundji have now reported cases, all of which within the Beni Health Zone. 6 people have died, 1 has tested negative and 1 currently still under treatment at the temporary Ebola Treatment Center in the General Reference Hospital in Beni. No new case of the Ebola virus disease has been recorded in the Beni Health Zone in North Kivu province in the past 16 days, the last confirmed case being on 30 October. The health response to the Ebola outbreak is currently focusing on community surveillance, which remains a major challenge with the low number of community alerts. The Ebola outbreak that erupted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s North Kivu Province in October \u2013 the second in 2021 \u2013 was today declared over, the national health authorities announced after no new cases were reported at the end of a 42-day countdown, or two incubation periods after the last confirmed case was discharged. In total, 11 cases (eight confirmed, three probable), including six deaths were reported in the outbreak that was declared on 8 October after a new case was confirmed in Beni health zone in the country\u2019s North Kivu Province.

Based on initial reports and assessments, the provinces where most damage has been reported are Faryab province in the Northern region, Nangarhar province in the Eastern region, and Daikundi province in the Central Highlands region. This is the third time that the Northern region has experienced flooding in less than a month, with seven people killed and 384 families affected in heavy rains that occurred on 21 and 26-27 March. As of 30 March, there have been no reports of displacement due to the floods. The health facility in the Kamgal area suffered damage due to a landslide, impacting local access to essential health services. In Kunar, the primary route between Wama and Parun was temporarily obstructed on March 30 by rockslides, disrupting transportation and relief access. Similarly, in Nuristan, the Neshagram village road to Waygal district has been blocked due to landslides, severing the connection of approximately 1,000 to 2,000 families with essential services and the district center. Between 10 and 16 April 2024, Afghanistan experienced heavy rains and flash floods across the central, central highlands, northern, northeastern, southern and western regions. Preliminary reports indicate that almost 1,590 families have been affected, with 35 people killed and another 47 people injured, while 46 families have been displaced. The most severely affected provinces that had fatalities were Badghis (4), Farah (2), Hilmand (5), Kabul (3), Kandahar (4), Laghman (2), Nangahar (1), Parwan (2) and Uruzgan (12). Additionally, more than 930 houses have been destroyed (198) or damaged (738), along with around 63,700 acres of agricultural land and at least 470 livestock reportedly killed. A new wave of rains is expected in the central, south, southeast and southwest regions of the country over the next week, with up to 30 mm of rainfall daily. These volumes are of concern because water reserves are filled to capacity, thus flooding is to be anticipated. The humanitarian impact continues to rise following heavy rainfall and floods that have been affecting several provinces of Afghanistan, particularly Badghis, Uruzgan, Farah, Paktia, Zabul, Helmand, Kunar, Kabul, Badakhshan, Ghor, Kandahar, Takhar, Parwan, Herat, Ghazni, Laghman, Nimroz, and Sar-e-Pol. As of 23 April, media report at least 90 fatalities, and dozens of injured people. In addition, more than 2,000 houses have been damaged, and thousands of livestock have died across the country. On 10 and 11 May, heavy rainfall and flash floods struck northeastern Afghanistan, affecting 21 districts across Badakhshan (5), Baghlan (10) and Takhar (6) provinces. Initial reports indicate 180 fatalities and more than 240 injuries across the three provinces. 8,975 homes were either destroyed or damaged leaving thousands without shelter. In addition to damage and destruction to roads, bridges, and public schools, 11 health facilities across Baghlan and Takhar provinces have been affected disrupting health and nutrition services, and 4,260 livestock have been lost. Heavy rainfall in central Afghanistan has caused a new wave of flash floods on the 17 May 2024. This is while the country still reeling from last week's devastating floods. The newly affected provinces are Ghor, Faryad, Sar-e Pul, Samangan, Balkh and Badghis. On 17 and 18 May, heavy rainfall led to flash floods in the Northern and Western regions of Afghanistan, impacting 10 districts in Ghor province (Charsada, Dawlatyar, Dolayna, Ferozkoh, Lal Wa Sarjangal, Murghab, Pasaband, Saghar, Shahrak, and Tolak districts), as well as eight districts in Faryab province (Almar, Bilcheragh, Chehlgazi, Dawlatabad, Khaibar, Maimana, Pashtun Kot and Qaysar districts). While assessments are ongoing for both provinces, initial reports indicate the large-scale floods have resulted in the deaths of at least 120 people with hundreds more people missing and extensive damage to private properties and civilian infrastructure. Humanitarian partners and local authorities anticipate the number of casualties will increase significantly as search and rescue efforts continue amid reports that people may be trapped under collapsed buildings. In northern Afghanistan, the initial flooding on 17 May in Faryab province reportedly affected around 560 households followed by a second wave of flooding on 18 May which affected approximately 1,300 households across eight districts. Humanitarian partners are ramping up response efforts following 10 and 11 May heavy rainfall and flash floods in Baghlan, Badakhshan and Takhar provinces that affected more than 60,000 people. Across the region to date, approximately 7,800 homes have been confirmed as either destroyed or damaged leaving over 5,000 families displaced according to the Afghan Ministry of Refugee and Repatriation (MoRR). Across the three provinces, MoRR reported 347 people were killed and 1,651 injured due to floods. To date, 225 people have been confirmed killed (137 in the northeastern, 80 in the northern and eight in the western region); more than half of the deaths occurred in Baghlan Province alone. A further 217 people have been wounded. So far in 2024, more than 119,160 people have been affected by heavy rainfall and flash flooding across 32 provinces. On 23 June, two landslides occurred in Paktia province in eastern Afghanistan, one in Orgor village in Saskani district and another in Wazi Zadran, causing casualties and damage. According to media reports, as of 25 June, a total of 12 people died, of whom seven in Orgor village and five in Wazi Zadran district. Flash floods were reported in Guzargah district of Baghlan Province on 27 June, affecting two villages and destroying/damaging an estimated 150 homes, underscoring pervasive vulnerability to floods in this region. Access has been largely restored across affected areas, however the recent flash flood on 27 June has rendered some areas unreachable by responding agencies. Similarly, some areas in the Western region continue to remain inaccessible due to road conditions. Widespread damage to public infrastructure continues to be reported, including to roads, health centers, water networks, and education facilities. Moreover, more than 2,200 acres of land have been damaged in the Western region, while over 5,500 individuals supporting their families have lost access to livelihoods in the Northern and Northeastern regions. On 15 July, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms affected eastern Afghanistan, particularly Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, causing flash floods and leading to casualties and damage. According to media, at least 35 people died while 350 others were injured in Nangarhar province. In the neighbouring Kunar province, five people died following floods in Asadabad city and in Asmar district. The humanitarian impact is increasing following the flash flood events that affected the eastern provinces of Nangarhar, Kunar, and Laghman. According to Save the Children and media, the death toll reached 40 people while 350 others have been injured. In addition, 1,500 children have been displaced and 400 houses have been destroyed. Infrastructure damage has been also reported to telecommunications networks and several roads have also been blocked, making it difficult to access affected areas. To date, the number of reported casualties has increased to 58 fatalities and 380 injured. So far, joint assessment teams (JATs) have assessed 1,925 affected families across Nangarhar, Kunar, and Laghman provinces; further assessments are ongoing. The number of tents destroyed in the Omari camp near the reception center at the Torkham border crossing point has increased from 400 to 550. Severe damage has also been sustained to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities. On 20 August 2024, heavy rains triggered flash floods which swept through Panjshir, Parwan, Kabul, Nangarhar and Kunar province in the eastern and central regions of Afghanistan. The incident affected a total of 1,006 families comprising 6,589 individuals, especially in Jalalabad and Kabul where the highest number of affected populations and damaged shelters were reported. Since early April, preliminary data compiled by the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) indicates that approximately 40,500 homes have been affected, along with substantial loss of life and injuries reported in various provinces. Provinces such as Baghlan, Ghor, and Helmand have experienced particularly high numbers of fatalities and injuries, with the total death toll in the region reaching at least 300. While Ghor and Helmand reported significant injuries, other provinces, including Panjsher, Kapisa, Bamyan, Nimroz, Paktya, and Kunduz, reported no casualties. In the month of November, Afghanistan experienced significant natural disasters, particularly due to heavy rainfall and subsequent flash floods. On November 23, heavy rainfall led to flash floods that severely impacted several districts in Kunduz, Baghlan, and Balkh provinces, resulting in the deaths of two children aged 10 months and one year. In terms of damages to infrastructure, approximately 460 houses, including mosques and madrasas, were destroyed. Approximately 30 drinking water wells were destroyed, increasing the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Humanitarian partners and local authorities are conducting search and rescue efforts, and assessments are ongoing.

The rainy/farming season has just begun with forecasts indicating intermitted heavy rainfall accompanied by severe windstorms. These imminent precipitations may further complicate the situation and severe consequences on the rural population in particular are expected. Twelve people have so far died and more than 109,000 people were affected by the windstorm and flash flood which hit Gambia on 7 July.

As per the warning, the deep Depression over Southwest Bay of Bengal moved north-northwestwards and intensified into a cyclonic storm \u201cFengal\u201d and was located about 280 km northeast of Kankasanthurai and 310 km north-northeast of Trincomalee. Due to the extreme weather conditions caused by Storm Fengal, rainfall exceeding 200 mm has been recorded in the Eastern, Northeastern, North Central, and Northern Provinces. Very strong winds, reaching speeds of up to 60 km/h, have caused damage to infrastructure, homes, and agricultural lands in these areas. Furthermore, the intensity of flooding has increased due to the release of water from medium-sized reservoirs, leading to a significant influx of flash floods. 46 minor to medium reservoirs in the Eastern and Northern provinces reported damage. Additionally, the level 2 spill gates of major reservoirs in the Ampara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Mullaitivu, and Anuradhapura districts were opened to release excess water, which resulted in further damage to small bridges and canals in many areas. The Disaster Management Centre reports that, as of 29 November, 441,373 individuals have been affected across 232 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in 24 districts due to the indirect impacts of Cyclone Fengal.

In week 8 (week ending 23 February 2020), 621 suspected cases were reported. 29 districts were in the epidemic phase in week 8. Since the beginning of the year, a total of 2 410 suspected cases and 23 deaths (CFR 1.0%) have been reported from Beboto, Kyabe, Goundi, Korbol, Kelo and Guelao. As attention and resources are shifting more and more towards COVID-19 prevention and response activities in Chad, the country is still grappling with a persistent measles epidemic that shows no signs of slowing down. 118 out of 126 health districts in Chad have been affected since the epidemic outbreak in May 2018, with southern provinces facing a rapid increase in cases. As of 30 April 2020, 28 health districts were in a declared measles epidemic. The Ministry of Public Health reported 7,635 suspected cases, with the highest number of registered cases in Beboto, Kyabe and Goundi health districts. In February, and before the first COVID-19 case in Chad was confirmed on 19 March, a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) emergency response team travelled to measles-affected regions, including Bebote, which is the most heavily impacted. As a result, 25,177 children aged between six months and nine years were vaccinated against measles. As of 25 October, 8,601 suspected cases of measles and 39 deaths have been notified in 100 out of 126 districts (during the same period in 2019, the tally was 25,283 suspected cases and 242 deaths). However, a period of higher transmission of the disease is expected. This is prompting the planning of a vaccination campaign in epidemic-prone health districts. Two national campaigns are envisaged, requiring funding of 3 million USD, of which 2 million are available through GAVI funds.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Medecins Sans Fronti\u00e8res is conducting a Measles outbreak investigation field mission in the affected area.

About 12,000 people in West New Britain and 4,000 people in East New Britain have been affected by the eruption. About 6,800 people have evacuated and are in two care centres in West New Britain. The volcanic activity is subsiding, and the alert level is expected to be lowered from level 2 to 1. Between 3,000 and 5,000 people voluntarily evacuated the immediate vicinity of Ulawun. The ash plume is moving generally south but has slowed in recent hours. Air Niugini has cancelled flights to Hoskins Airport until further assessments are made. The cluster system is to be activated in response to food, water, shelter and non-food item needs among the evacuees. As the area has been cut off from the highway, relief items will be transported by road from Kimbe to Bialla, and then via helicopter to those affected. Approximately 10,620 people have congregated in at least ten care centre sites, according to local-level government authorities in Bialla, West New Britain. Another 427 people are in a single care centre in East New Britain. No casualties have been reported. Ashfall has been observed across Talesea District, and down to Kimbe. The authorities in West New Britain have declared a provincial state of emergency and have activated their emergency response plan for Mt. Ulawun, including the establishment of a forward base in Bialla. All communities within a 20-kilometre radius of the volcano were instructed to relocate to designated safe zones. Hoskins airport was opened at 17:00 today by the airport authority, National Airports Corporation. It is expected that Air Niugini flights will resume over the weekend pending an air quality assessment. As of 2 July, approximately 13,250 people have congregated in at least 9 care centre sites in West New Britain. Two people have been reportedly sustained light injuries during the relocation. Overcrowding has been observed in the care centre sites. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a large number of people are staying in open areas without shelter, minimal food supplies, with limited access to clean drinking water, latrines, and sanitation. There are public health risks of vector-borne diseases, measles, and other vaccine-preventable and diarrhoeal diseases. Due to heavy ashfall remaining on the runway, Air Niugini flights into Hoskins Airport were cancelled again as of 1 July until a further review is undertaken by the airline. As of 5 July, there is an estimated 7,318 people staying in seven evacuation sites in West New Britain Province, and 2,538 people are staying in one evacuation site in East New Britain Province, according to IOM displacement profiles. In West New Britain, 86 per cent of those displaced are staying in the government-run care centres, with around 16 per cent staying in open spaces or with no shelter. Five of the six sites reported health-related concerns, including malaria and coughs and only one site was reported to have health services. In East New Britain, around 85 per cent of people displaced are living in makeshift shelters. The site was reported to lack functioning toilets or separate bathing facilities and the primary source of drinking water are nearby streams. Reported health problems include malaria and diarrhoea; there are no health services available near the site. As of 12 Jul, the Rabaul Volcanological Observatory\u2019s (RVO) preliminary assessment indicates that people evacuated in East New Britain Province may return home immediately, while those evacuated in West New Britain Province may be able to return home in a week\u2019s time. The alert level remains at 1, indicating a low threat to life. West New Britain provincial authorities have downgraded the State of Emergency on 12 July, noting that it would be scaling down operations and officers would be returning to their normal duties. Gaps remain in addressing evacuees\u2019 needs at care centres, apart from food. A major concern remains the risk of disease outbreaks due to a lack of access to water, poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, and general living conditions at the care centres and other evacuation sites. A government assessment of communities home to approximately 7,500 people, showed nearly all household food gardens were covered in ash and likely lost. Schools, due to resume on 8 July, remained suspended. Evacuees are still located in informal sites along the Pandi River. Access to clean water and sanitation and hygiene continue to be priorities, as well as a growing need to address psychosocial issues and establish safe recreational zones for children and support programs for women. The Government has distributed US$66,700 worth of food relief to evacuation sites, and public health authorities have provided medical assistance. In-country support from humanitarian partners has included provision of food, emergency shelter items and non-food items, essential medicines and supplies, and nutritional supplements. Ulawun volcano, on the island of New Britain, erupted on 3 August, producing a short but strong eruption with a 100 metre fire fountain and an 19,000 metre ash plume. Further imminent eruptions are unlikely and as of 5 August, the risk level, which was at \u2018Stage 3\u2019, has been downgraded to \u2018Stage 1.\u2019 Communities to the west and southwest of the volcano, such as Navo, Kabaya and Kimbe, have been most severely affected. A response team from the West New Britain Provincial Disaster Centre is supporting ongoing relief operations and conducting an assessment on the impact of the ashfall. Approximately 8,000 people remain displaced following earlier eruptions of Ulawan in June, with many of the displaced people still living in care centres. Ulawun erupted at about 5:00 a.m. local time (UTC+10) on 1 October, following a swarm of seismic activity that began around 11:30 a.m. local time on 30 September. The eruption was visible from red incandescent glow shooting up less than 100m from the base and an ash plume rising less than 1,000 metres. Preliminary observations suggest areas in the westerly direction may be affected by ashfall, but the current level of exposure to ashfall remains low. The West New Britain Provincial Disaster Centre reported that 6 care centres are open for evacuating residents. As of two weeks ago, approximately 6,200 people were staying in the care centres, which had remained open since the previous eruptions. Following the Mount Ulawun eruption on 1 October, the volcanic explosion activity continues, the ash plume rose 6,100 m altitude and is moving in south-west direction at 37 km/h. The eruption has forced the evacuation of several people who recently returned to their homes, following a previous eruption and evacuation. As of 10.00 a.m. local time on 2 October, the eruption of Ulawun continues via a new vent, low on its south-west flank. The alert level remains at stage 3, indicating a high threat to life. Seismicity remains high with tremors of similar intensity or slightly above. If the eruption continues, or the lava effusion rate increases, areas to the north-west of the current vent may be affected. Ash can be expected in down-wind areas. The activity of Mount Ulawun (West New Britain Province, New Britain island) is slightly decreasing since the ash plume rose approximately 3,000 m. According to media, people living close to the volcano have been preventively evacuated. The Manam volcano (Manam island) located 700 km west of Mount Ulawun began to erupt on 28 September and, as of 2 October, the ash column has risen to 3,000 m. There are no reports of any casualties or damage. According to the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, as of 2 October, a red aviation color code has been issued both for Ulawun and Manam. Mount Ulawun in West New Britain erupted on 1 October. Eruptions continued for several days, sending ash several kilometres in the air. Lava flowed up to 3km from the north-west side of the vent, but the lava flow did not cause any damage to life or property. On 7 October, the Rabaul Volcanological Observatory (RVO) lowered the alert level to Stage 2. Seven care centres, hosting around 6,200 people from previous eruptions, remain open in the area, providing food assistance to those displaced.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"The West New Britain provincial authorities are assessing the affected area.

According to local authorities, the number goes up to 150,000 for eastern Jonglei. Heavy rainfall has been affecting central and eastern States of the country (in particular Jonglei, Eastern Nile, and Pibor States) since late July, causing the White Nile River, and the Akobo River to overflow, triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. In Jonglei State, media report as of 14 August, around 200,000 displaced people, and thousands of destroyed houses across Bor South, Twic East, Duk, and Ayod Counties. In the eastern part of Upper Nile State, approximately 30,000 people were reported affected across the Renk County. In Pibor state, a number of families were reported displaced throughout Pochalla County. More than 600,000 people have been affected by flooding in areas along the White Nile since July, with Jonglei and Lakes the worst affected states.

In Thailand, severe weather in Northern Thailand has caused significant flooding and landslides affecting about 14,328 households. Rescue teams are responding to the flood situation. In Laos, floods in Luang Namtha province are affecting 40,255 people. Heavy rainfall has also triggered floods in northern Myanmar especially in Tachileik at the border with Thailand. The Mekong river is expected to reach danger levels in Laos and Cambodia. Five days after Typhoon Yagi struck northern Viet Nam, the country is facing severe flooding and landslides as a result of heavy and prolonged rains. As of 12 September, at least 199 people are reported dead with 128 people missing. Approximately 3 million people have no access to safe drinking water and sanitation, causing risk of disease, and 550 health facilities and more than 800 schools have been damaged. Following Typhoon Yagi\u2019s landfall on 7 September, heavy rains and flooding have severely impacted northern and central provinces in Lao PDR, with nearly 140,000 people affected. The worst-hit areas include Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, and Vientiane Capital, along with significant impacts in Phongsaly, Oudomxay, Bokeo, Xiengkhouang, and Xayaboury.

Current reports show floods have damaged 3,167 hectares of paddy fields, 121 houses, 41 roads, and 7 health facilities, while actual numbers are likely to be far higher. Viet Nam: On 16 September, the VDDMA reported 291 fatalities, 38 people missing and 237,000 homes damaged as a result of the typhoon, rains and landslides. An additional 84,000 homes were flooded, and 1,530 schools and 570 health facilities were damaged. According to the Minister of Planning and Investment, initial damage assessments from the typhoon amounted to VN\u011040 trillion ($1.6 billion) in damages. Some three million people are affected, including 1.3 million people in 26 provinces who suffered from damaged and flooded homes. Since 9 September, heavy rains caused by the monsoon season and remnants of Typhoon Yagi have led to severe flooding across Myanmar. Central Myanmar is currently the hardest hit. The flood impacted 59 townships in nine regions and states, including the state\u2019s capital, Nay Pyi Taw, Bago, Kayah, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, and eastern and southern Shan. There has been significant damage to road networks, transportation, telecommunications, and electricity in affected areas. Most areas remain flooded, although some townships have started to see receding water levels. While data verification is challenging, an estimated 631,000 people might have been affected by flooding across the country. Myanmar: As of 17 September, there has been 113 reported deaths. In Mandalay, more than 53,000 people were affected in Yamethin. The Sa Mone Dam breach flooded 12 villages, submerged 40,000 acres of farmland, and left 10,000 people in urgent need of aid. Flooding in Bago worsened in Taungoo Township, surpassing August flood levels and affecting 1,200 households. In total more than 87,000 people affected in six townships in Bago Region. In Eastern Shan, flash floods destroyed a key bridge, disrupting transportation and communication. Southern Shan faced widespread flooding, affecting 13 townships, with more than half the area inundated, including tourism infrastructure. In the Southeast, Mon, Kayin, and Kayah states experienced severe flooding, displacing people and damaging infrastructure, particularly in IDP camps and low-lying areas. In Nay Pyi Taw, four townships were heavily flooded, affecting around 60,000 people. As of 27 September, the severe floods caused more than 360 fatalities, with more than 100 people missing and 320,000 people displaced, forcing them into temporary camps/evacuation centres that were often overcrowded and lacked sufficient access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities. Likewise, the floods and landslides caused the destruction of more than 141,000 buildings, including homes, schools, offices, and critical infrastructure, such as 533 roads and bridges. Furthermore, several concurrent low-pressure systems around Bay of Bengal resulted in persistent rains, leading to additional flooding. In the beginning of October, recurrent flooding impacted Mandalay region, Eastern and Southern Shan states, disrupting needs analysis, relief deliveries, and humanitarian assistance efforts, while compounding the needs of the vulnerable population affected by multiple hazards. Local markets, health facilities, and homes were devastated, significantly reducing access to food, water, and medical supplies. In Lao PDR, Tropical Cyclone Yagi and the Southwest Monsoon have affected 1,208 villages across 106 districts in 15 provinces, including Vientiane Capital and Borikhamxay. According to the NDMO Lao PDR, the cyclone and monsoon have resulted in seven fatalities and impacted approximately 185,800 people (76,100 families). The estimated cost of damages stands at around 7.9 million USD, with significant destruction including 252 road sections, 77 schools, 11 health facilities, 298 houses, and 24,600 hectares of agricultural land. An estimated 48,500 children have been impacted, with at least 24,000 children in need of critical support. Approximately 92,000 people are in need of water, sanitation, and health services; 10,000 children and adolescents affected by the floods are in need of community-based mental health and psychosocial support activities. Some 3.6 million people in nearly half (26) of Viet Nam\u2019s 63 provinces and cities were affected by the typhoon and subsequent floods and landslides. Across the country, more than 240,599 homes, 1,530 schools, and 570 health facilities were damaged, with another 73,248 homes submerged in floodwaters. More than 72,500 people are estimated to be in need of safe shelter as a result of destroyed or severely damaged homes. About 570,000 people, including approx.163,020 children, are in need of assistance. The hardest-hit areas include rural, ethnic minorities and low-income communities where children were already facing multiple challenges. Typhoon Yagi was recorded as the strongest typhoon Viet Nam has experienced in the past 30 years. It affected the entire northern region, home to a population of 19 million. Among the 12 most damaged provinces, Lao Cai, Tuyen Quang, and Yen Bai have declared a state of emergency. As of 27 September 2024, the typhoon resulted in 318 deaths, 26 missing persons, 1,976 injuries, the evacuation of over 130,000 people, and initial damages amounting to more than VND 81,000 billion (approximately CHF 2,43 billion), as reported in the conference on \u201cPreliminary, evaluating, learning experiences on the prevention and overcoming of the consequences of typhoon No. 3\u201d chaired by the Prime Minister of Viet Nam and attended by the leaders of ministries, branches, 26 provinces and cities. The typhoon left a trail of devastation, affecting public and private properties, including offices, schools, and buildings, many of which suffered roof damage, while large areas experienced disruptions to telecommunications and power. As of 23 October, the Viet Nam Disaster and Dyke Management Authority (VDDMA) reported 321 deaths, 24 people missing, and 1,978 people injured. Many homes, healthcare facilities, schools were also damaged because of Typhoon Yagi and subsequent rains and landslides. The Typhoon affected 3,6 million people across 26 provinces, with the response prioritizing 1,6 million people in 11 provinces. Efforts are focused on reaching 570,000 individuals in need, targeting 300,000 in the three hardest-hit provinces: Yen Bai, Lao Cai, and Cao Bang. Following the devastation caused by Typhoon Yagi\u2014one of the most powerful storms to hit Southeast Asia in decades \u2013 heavy rains have continued to batter many of the hardest-hit areas. Needs assessments reveal that over 5.6 million people, including at least 1.6 million children, were directly affected by the resulting floods and landslides across Viet Nam, Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Thailand. The disaster has severely disrupted access to clean water, essential social services, education, healthcare, food, and shelter, leaving millions in urgent need of assistance. [In Vietnam], three months after the typhoon children and families in affected areas still face acute deprivations and risks. Health and water systems remain damaged, denying 570,000 people access to safe drinking water and clean sanitation, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks and interruptions to routine immunization. About 220,000 children under five and 70,000 pregnant and lactating women remain at risk of malnutrition due to disrupted health and other services, food shortages and lack of clean water. Over 830,000 children in the worst-affected areas experienced a loss of 60-120 hours of learning and are being impacted by the damage to school infrastructure and learning materials. Disruptions of education in typhoon-affected regions, which already have lower learning outcomes, are increasing existing disparities, especially among ethnic minority children.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"The Government of Viet Nam, with support of local authorities, mobilized a large-scale response, deploying over 438,000 officers, soldiers, communal disaster response teams, and mass organization members, assisting in evacuations, and coordinating with national and international partners for immediate relief efforts.

Notably, this incident involved weather-driven waves and inundation, distinct from a tsunami. The powerful winds associated with the storm system generated a substantial swell that affected Roi-Namur and other areas such as Arno Atoll and the runway in Ailinglapalap. There are suspicions that additional islands and atolls (namely: Jaluit, Arno, Namu, Alinglaplap, Wotje, Jabot, Namdrik, Kili, Kwajalein) may have been affected, although ground reports are limited and experiencing delays due to communication and infrastructure challenges.

As one of the strongest typhoons to have formed this year, preliminary information from the affected areas of Quezon and Aurora provinces indicates destructive wind damage in some areas of initial landfall, possibly affecting majority of houses in Polillo Islands. The storm also brought torrential rains with parts of Bulacan and Pampanga currently inundated with flood waters from the Sierra Madre Mountain range and the nearby dams. As per initial government data, more than 2,400 families were pre-emptively evacuated. Thirty-four evacuation centers are operational, with reports of some evacuees already heading home. Five casualties have been reported so far, all of whom were rescuers on patrol from the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office of Bulacan. On 27 September, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported 60,817 affected people and 51,811 displaced in 976 evacuation centres and outside. These numbers went up on the 29th, with more than 714,200 people (195,900 families) affected in the Regions I, II, III, CALABARAZON, V and CAR. According to government reporting, the number of casualties has increased to eight, with five still missing. While most of those that preemptively evacuated have by now headed home, 22,800 persons remain displaced, 11,800 of whom are taking temporary shelter in 127 still open evacuation centres and the rest staying with relatives or friends. Most of those displaced reside in Region 3, where the storm made its second landfall. With more than 20,600 houses reportedly damaged, 2,500 of which are totally damaged, repairs will need to be made due to the possibility of more storms entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility in the coming weeks and months. Around 46,400 people remained displaced, with 3,091 people in 26 evacuation centers. Severe winds damaged 58,994 houses (51,600 partially, 7,344 totally damaged), while torrential rains left parts of Bulacan province underwater. As of 3 Oct, five people remain missing and 12 people have been confirmed dead, five of whom were emergency responders. The Department of Agriculture estimated that around 170,700 hectares of agricultural areas had been damaged, equivalent to USD $52.8 million in losses.

At least 15 electricity circuits and 115 aqueducts have been affected, causing disruptions in electricity service for more than 150,000 people and water service for some 1.8 million people. The National Institute of Drinking Water and Sewage and EDESUR are working to restore their respective services in the affected areas. According to preliminary reports, more than 1,500 homes, 6 roads and 5 bridges have been affected. Some 19 communities remain cut off due to the overflow of rivers. Fourteen provinces (Pedernales, San Juan, Barahona, Azua, San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa, Bahoruco, Independencia, El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a, San Crist\u00f3bal, Peravia, S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez, El Distrito Nacional, Santo Domingo and Duarte) across the country remain at a red alert level due to the risk of further flooding and landslides. Heavy rainfall is forecast to continue through until 20 November. As of 21 November, severe rains and subsequent flooding have left 24 people dead, displaced nearly 18,000 people, affected 3,500 homes, and cut off some 45 communities. About 1.1 million people are still without access to safe water. The UN is also helping the Ministry of Health with the procurement of 50,000 cholera vaccine doses after authorities detected 16 cases, 12 among Haitian migrants. There are concerns that damages to water management systems may aggravate an ongoing dengue outbreak that has led to 12,000 cases so far in 2023. According to information from 22 November, 7,412 homes were affected, 14 partially affected and 22 were destroyed. At least 37,060 people were displaced to safe areas and 55 communities are isolated. A total of 4 shelters were opened, housing 158 people, and 59 water services were affected, of which 55 are inoperable. Almost three weeks after intense rainfall and flooding hit the Dominican Republic on 17 and 18 November, a Damage and Needs Assessment conducted in North Santo Domingo and the province of Duarte indicates that populations in the most affected communities require food, clean water, hygiene and sanitation supplies, medicines, and the repair or reconstruction of homes. According to estimations from the government\u2019s social protection system (SIUBEN), the flooding affected at least 340,000 people in the provinces of Duarte, Santo Domingo, San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa, Barahona, Bahoruco, San Juan de la Maguana, S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez, Peravia, Azua, Distrito Nacional and San Crist\u00f3bal. Some 34 people died, 37,000 were displaced and approximately 7,412 homes were severely damaged. Around 61 per cent of damaged homes were in the province of Duarte, while 13 per cent were in Distrito Nacional and the Santo Domingo province. The agricultural sector also faced significant losses, with extensive damage to crops, greenhouses, and livestock, affecting over 7,000 producers in various provinces. President Luis Abinader estimated the damages to exceed US$460 million (excluding the Ministry of Public Works and Communications' budget). In the aftermath of the rains, ongoing health crises have continued to escalate. There has been an alarming surge of dengue, with 17,360 suspected cases, including 128 severe cases and 19 deaths this year. Additionally, a confirmed cholera outbreak in Barahona, heavily impacted by the floods, reported 29 cases, contributing to the overall national count of 1,109 suspected cases, 115 confirmed cases, and one death. The widespread impact of the event highlights the vulnerabilities of the country and the need to strengthen capacities to prevent, prepare and respond effectively. On 21 December 2023, the Emergency Operation Center of Dominican Republic (COE per its acronym in Spanish) published information about the heavy rains in the country. A total of 4 provinces are in yellow alert due to the flooding (3 decrease since the 20 December report).

At least 10 people, including children, are still missing in Arghandab, Daman, Spin Boldak and Dand Districts. It is anticipated that up to 2,000 homes may have been damaged across all affected districts including Kandahar City. As of 3 March, heavy rains have caused flooding in six provinces, Kandahar, Kunar, Zabul, Nimroz, Hirat and Farah. In Kandahar, more than 1,000 people stranded by the flood waters have been rescued by ANSF. Reports suggest that 85 per cent of Farah city has been flooded. As of 4 March, eight provinces have been affected by heavy rains and flooding, according Government reports.

According to assessments conducted by the Government and humanitarian partners, 2,800 houses have been damaged and 1,850 houses destroyed. Assessments are still ongoing in affected areas that are difficult to access due to insecurity. Humanitarian partners have so far provided 673 flood-affected households with tents, NFIs including winter clothes, food assistance and hygiene kits. The Government has reportedly allocated 126 million Afghanis (US$1.7m) for assistance including shelter repairs, agricultural assistance and food. Since 2 March, there has also been extensive flooding in Hilmand, Herat and Farah provinces, and humanitarian partners are continuing to conduct assessments and provide assistance in these areas. Heavy rainfall has being affecting central, southern and western Afghanistan over the past two weeks, triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The most affected provinces are Kandahar, Helmand, Farah, Herat and Badghis. According to ACAPS (Assessment Capacities Project), as of 13 March, the death toll stands at 70, more than 8,670 houses have been damaged and approximately 250,000 people have been affected. Infrastructure damage, rugged terrain and the ongoing rainfall are hindering the response. Insecurity throughout the country remains high and may restrict operations. Nevertheless, the humanitarian response is being put in place to assist those affected with emergency shelter, food, non-food items, winter clothes and emergency latrines. Over the next 72 hours, locally heavy rain and snowfall are forecast over Kabul area and north-eastern areas of the country. Moderate rainfall and snowfall are forecast over the central areas of the country. As of 19 March, more than 122,600 people across 14 provinces have been identified as being affected by the March floods and in need of humanitarian assistance. As a result of the floods, 63 people are known to have died and a further 31 people have been injured. The highest number of affected people are in Farah, where almost 52,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance. A further 32,750 people in Kandahar and 18,340 people in Hilmand also require assistance. Heavy rains caused flash flooding on 27, 28 and 29 March in six provinces - Faryab, Balkh, Jawzjan, and Sar-e-Pul province in the Northern Region, and Hirat and Badghis in the Western Region. An estimated 17,000 people have been affected with Balkh and Hirat suffering the worst impacts. In Balkh, unconfirmed reports suggest several fatalities in Chemtal district, with up to 645 families (4,515 people) affected throughout the Province. In Hirat, Ministry of Health has reported that eight people died and nine were injured in six districts following flash flooding, while more than 1,000 families may have been affected. This new flooding adds to the impact of the overall flood emergency, with Farah and Kandahar the most effected to date. Since the beginning of 2019, more than 163,000 people have now been affected by floods, including those in the past week. A total of more than 42,000 people have been displaced. After heavy rainfall that affected 22 out of the 34 Provinces of Afghanistan over the past few days, the death toll has risen to at least 16. According to media, as of 18 April at 8.00 UTC, in eastern Nangarhar Province, 11 people have died, six are injured and 266 houses were washed away, while in the western Province of Herat the death toll stands at five. Unseasonal heavy rains and floods affected a number of regions of Afghanistan as well as Kabul, between 13 and 19 April. As of 22 April, 1,700 people have been affected with 16 people killed, 112 injured, and 250 houses damaged or destroyed due to flash floods. The floods have also damaged crops and infrastructure, including roads.

It is anticipated that more rains shall fall in the coming months with little resources on the ground to respond to the needs of people in different provinces. The resilience of people in most of the provinces is already weak because of earlier protracted drought. There is a huge need in emergency shelter on the ground. Besides, there is continuous population movement from the rural villages to safer places with available humanitarian assistance and better basic services. Heavy rainfall in recent days has triggered flash floods in a number of areas with Kabul, Parwan, Ghour, Herat, Bamyan and Ghazni most affected. According to media reports, as of 27 May at 8.00 UTC, 24 people have died, 11 are injured and 550 affected. 220 houses have been destroyed and 116 partially damaged.

As of 03 November, the official partial estimates of damage caused by both typhoons Sarika and Haima, which hit northern Luzon on 19 October, included 248,872 tonnes of lost crops. Large numbers of people are still living in temporary shelters and relying on humanitarian support. Most of the population affected by the typhoons are critically dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods and many are vulnerable to food insecurity. As of 04 November, preliminary official estimates indicated that about 400,000 hectares of paddy, maize and high value crops (such as mango, banana, papaya, cassava and vegetables) were adversely affected by both typhoons Haima and Sarika. The overall damage to the agriculture sector was estimated to be close to USD 234 million. However, the overall impact on 2016 cereal crops is expected to be limited. On 18 October, Typhoon Sarika made landfall on China's southern island of Hainan as a Category 2 typhoon with torrential rain and winds of up to 162 km/h. Nearly 500,000 people were evacuated from coastal and low-lying areas. As of 19 October in Hainan province, more than 500 houses collapsed and more than 2,000 were damaged, according to China's Ministry of Civil Affairs. Severe flooding triggered by heavy rainfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam has forced thousands of families to evacuate to safer grounds and left many other residents stranded without food or safe drinking water in their homes. According to local authorities, at least 21 people have died, 18 were injured, and 8 others are still missing after the floods inundated more than 27,000 houses and damaged 770 homes in the provinces of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Binh, which was the most impacted. Around 1,600 hectares of rice fields have been damaged and some families lost their livestock in the floods.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"On 17 November, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent launched an Emergency Appeal seeking 1.4 million Swiss francs to support the Viet Nam Red Cross (VNRC) to deliver assistance and support to 30,775 people for nine months, with a focus on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); shelter (including household non-food items); disaster risk reduction and National Society capacity building. According to the IFRC, people in affected areas have inadequate access to basic hygiene and limited access to safe water and nutritional food, potentially exposing them to health risks. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reports that Typhoon Sarika affected a total of 70,169 families, or 300,396 people, in six regions: I, II, III, CALABARZON, V and CAR. On 20 December, the European Commission announced the release of \u20ac328,000 in humanitarian aid funding to channel emergency relief to communities affected by typhoons Sarika and Haima.

Local authorities have declared an orange level for the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitep\u00e9quez to be able to provide emergency assistance to the affected areas, and on September 27 2017, CONRED declared Red Alert in Retalhuleu and Suchitep\u00e9quez, to provide assistance to the local emergencies. Continuous rains have fallen in the department of Alta Verapaz for the entire month of October 2017, affecting 62 rural and urban communities in 8 municipalities due to increased water levels and the overflow of the Cahab\u00f3n, Chixoy, Icbolay and Polochic Rivers. The heavy rains that continue to pound the area are compounded by the presence of an easterly wave, the arrival of Tropical Storm Selma, increased humidity saturation levels and swollen rivers that threaten to impact further already flooded areas.

The heavy rainfall led to the flooding of the central streets in Gurjaani municipality, including the surrounding areas of the central agricultural market, resulting in severe difficulties in transportation and mobility. Additionally, sudden mudflows and landslides caused the destruction of roads, blockages from fallen trees, and damage to vital infrastructure like bridges and power transmission towers. Specifically, the flooding affected several areas in Gurjaani municipality, including Gurjaani, Chumlaki, Tchandari, Vejini, Dzirkoki, Kolagi, Bakurtsikhe, and Kodalo. In Lentekhi, which is one of the highest mountainous populated areas in Georgia, the storms affected Chikhareshi, Jakhunderi, Nakisheri, Skhedi, Upper Shkedi, Akhalsheni, Panaga, and Lekosadeni villages. State infrastructure such as bridges, in-land roads, and power transmission towers were also damaged. Although Georgia is prone to flooding and hailstorms, it is worth noting that these kinds of floods are not common in either of these municipalities, as none of them are located in high-risk flash flood zones. It is the first time in recent decades that Gurjaani municipality faced such a disaster. Consequently, the population was not prepared for potential effects of this sudden disaster in the region.

The houses of 585 other households (2,925 individuals), residing in the locality of Habil\u00e9, were partially damaged. On Friday 5 August, several neighbourhoods were flooded after heavy rains hit in the capital city of Chad, Ndjamena. According to OCHA, the rains keep affecting various regions of the country, including the province of Logone Oriental, causing human and material damage, and loss of livelihoods to a significant part of the population. The rapid assessment conducted by Red Cross of Chad (RCC) teams between 5 and 10 August 2022 identified at least 20,657 people affected, and the number continues to rise. Material damage is estimated at 2,067 houses completely destroyed. During the week of 01 to 7 August 2022, the successive heavy rainfall in N'Djamena, combined with the low-lying position of the Gozator hospital and the lack of drainage in its vicinity caused the main basin behind it to overflow and led to an unprecedented flooding of the hospital. According to the latest report of UN OCHA, almost 623,000 people have been affected across 16 of the 23 Provinces, including the Capital N\u2019Djamena with 44,839 affected people. The worst-hit Provinces are Tandjil\u00e9 (southern Chad) with 166,258 affected people, followed by Logone (147,129 people), Mandoul (82,608), and Sila (77,357). In the capital, N\u2019Djamena, a quarter of the city is flooded, and the humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly as over 50,000 people were displaced in the span of just days. This figure may double in the next week, as waters of the Logone and Chari rivers from the south continue to flood the capital on their way to Lake Chad. Since September 8, heavy rains battered the south of the country, causing the Chari and Logone rivers (which meet in the capital city of N'Djamena) to overflow their banks and forcing 181,720 people (28,907 households) to flee their homes and take refuge in public spaces. The flooding is a result of heavy rainfall across the country, overflowing of rivers and/or the breaching of dikes. As of January 20, 2023, the most affected provinces are Lac with 250,091 victims, Mayo Kebbi Est with 228,708 victims, Mayo Kebi Ouest (50,022 victims), Logone Occidental (147,129 victims), Logone Oriental (10,052 victims), Tandjil\u00e9 (138,831 victims), Mandoul (82,608 victims), Salamat (19,080 victims), Sila (92,600 victims), Gu\u00e9ra (65,047 victims), and Batha (26,466 victims). More than 1.4 million people were affected by floods in Chad in 2022 and many of them remain displaced in several camps in N'Djamena and Lac provinces. As of 29 of March 2023, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated that around 300,000 people were still in dire needs of assistance in several sites in N'Djamena and Bol.

This has similarly affected crop development, with many areas experiencing failed or near failed harvests. Only Ambovombe commune received favorably heavy rains in July that allowed some farmers to plant new maize and potato crops. Poor and very poor households in MG23 (the Mahafaly plains) in the southwest of Madagascar are experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity because of poor or failed agricultural production and the resulting early dependence on markets for food. In Androy Semi-Arid Cassava, Maize and Livestock (MG 24), food security is deteriorating following the harvest period as stocks deplete and poor and very poor households are currently in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) with the exception of Ambovombe where the situation is better. Food insecurity is less severe in the Southeast (MG 19) and Rice and lima bean (MG 20) which remain in Stressed (IPC Phase 2). The rest of the country remains in Minimal (IPC Phase 1). According to Crop and Food Security Assessment (CFSAM) of August 2018, rainfall deficits and fall armyworm attacks have had significant impact on food production levels (particularly staple crops such as maize and cassava), compromising access to food for the majority of households.

Of the ten hardest-hit southern districts, Amboasary is the epicenter; families barely scrape together enough food with raw mangoes and tamarind often their only food source. Mothers can no longer breastfeed and are forced to give their infants water which is in scarce supply. A WFP assessment in Amboasary last month found three out of four children had quit school - mostly to help their parents forage for food.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"In coordination with the Government of Madagascar and in collaboration with the humanitarian community, WFP\u2019s response plan will focus on providing food and nutritional assistance to the populations that are classified in IPC crisis and in emergency phases from September-December 2018.

It is expected that other actors in the food security sector (government and NGOs) will provide assistance to 35% of the population in IPC 3 and 4 phases. A second response phase to support drought-affected communities through early recovery interventions is planned for the January-March 2019 period. During both response phases, WFP will work closely with FAO and other food security and livelihoods cluster members to ensure that the assistance provided is complementary. Humanitarian actors are currently delivering assistance to approximately 415,463 beneficiaries across the Grand South, with the highest levels of assistance in Ampanihy and Betoiky. 154,078 beneficiaries are receiving 100,000 MGA per month in cash transfers, and 261,385 beneficiaries are receiving 30 kg of rice, 5 kg of legumes, and 3 kg of cooking oil per month.

There is a particular alert for Rohingya camps and hill districts for heavy rainfall and subsequent landslide risks. The overall potential exposed population is 1.9 million, who may be displaced during the cyclone, with almost 0.5 million houses estimated to be possibly damaged or destroyed. The cyclone made landfall over the border area between India, West Bengal state and Bangladesh, Khulna division on 26 May around 18.00 UTC. Tidal surges as high as 12 feet, heavy rainfall, and wind speeds of up to 120 km/h have led to inundation of many southwestern coastal areas of Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, over 800,000 people have been evacuated to safer areas in 16 coastal districts ahead of the cyclone in 9,000 shelters. Tens of thousands of volunteers had been mobilized by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) to quicken the evacuation efforts and relief has already been transported to remote areas. 10,599 houses are so far reported fully destroyed, while 18,605 are reported partially destroyed, and 9 people are reported dead. Millions are without power. Over the next 48 hours, very heavy rainfall and strong winds are expected over West Bengal and most of Bangladesh. As of 28 May, ten casualties are reported across southern Bangladesh and six more in the West Bengal state (India). Around 800,000 are displaced across Bangladesh and 150,000 in India. Approximately 3.75 million of affected people in both countries. Around 115,000 houses were reported damaged in India and 35,000 destroyed in Bangladesh, fostering high risk of protracted displacement. Media report, as of 29 May, a total of 54 fatalities, of which 44 in India and 10 across Bangladesh. In India, 27 fatalities and seven missing people were reported across the Mizoram state, seven fatalities in West Bengal, four fatalities and 18 injured people in Assam, four fatalities in Nagaland and two fatalities and four injured people in Meghalaya. More than 37,000 damaged houses were reported across the affected states. In Bangladesh, around 807,000 people have been evacuated in nearly 9,500 shelters and around 70,285 houses have been completely destroyed, 107,176 of which partially damaged. The humanitarian impact is increasing after the passage of tropical storm REMAL which made landfall near the Bangladesh-India border and crossed north-eastern India on 26-28 May. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), as of 29 May, in Bangladesh 16 people died, 807,023 people have been evacuated to 9,424 evacuation centres and almost 3.5 million people have been affected. In addition, 40,246 houses were completely damaged, and 131,678 others were partially damaged. The rain and high tides damaged some embankments and flooded coastal areas in the Sundarbans. Rain brought by the cyclone, flooded roads also in the capital Dhaka. In India, media report at least 37 fatalities, most of them in Mizoram State, dozens missing people, and hundreds of evacuated. The worst affected states are Mizoram, West Bengal, Assam, and Meghalaya. Tropical storm REMAL struck northeastern India and Bangladesh from May 26-28, causing severe flooding and landslides. In India's northeast, 39 people were reported dead, with the highest fatalities in Mizoram. Dozens remain missing, over 500 were injured, and significant displacement has occurred, with nearly 21,000 affected and 175 homes damaged across Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Tripura. In Manipur, the storm impacted around 188,143 people and damaged over 24,000 houses. West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district saw 1.9 million people affected, thousands of homes damaged, and over 150,000 people evacuated to relief camps. Further assessments are pending. In Bangladesh, the cyclone's aftermath left 16 dead and affected 3.75 million people, according to Save the Children. Approximately 150,000 homes were hit, affecting 639,000 people, including many children. In India, 10 days after the cyclone Remal made a landfall, there has been random episodes of unseasonal rainfall in the affected area. As per media reports 07 people have lost their lives and nearly 100 people have been injured as a consequence of the cyclone. People continue to live in damaged and uninhabitable conditions with unusable toilet facility conditions. Some local donor agencies have supported with tarpaulin sheets which is providing temporary relief. There were more than 1,400 relief camps functional during the cyclone, now they have been closed and people have returned to their homes, many of which have been partially or completely destroyed. As per government reports from the district of South 24 Parganas, 23 blocks, 249 Gram Panchayats (village level government administration), 1,905,032 people are affected. Government has distributed 70,914 tarpaulins and 153,353 fresh cooked meals to the impacted people. In Bangladesh, according to the Department of Disaster Management (DDM), under the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), about 4.6 million people were affected by Cyclone Remal in 19 districts, and 16 people died across seven districts. Approximately 807,023 people were evacuated to 9,424 evacuation shelters across 19 districts. Over 173,000 houses were damaged, including 40,338 that were completely uninhabitable. About 80,591 hectares of cultivable land were inundated. Additionally, 50,000 fish enclosures, 34,000 ponds, and 4,000 crab farms were severely flooded, disrupting food supply chains, and exacerbating livelihoods and food insecurity. More than 530,000 farmers have been affected by damage to crops worth BDT 10,595 million (USD 90.7 million). Bangladesh has recently undergone civil unrest and turmoil, compounding the already existing humanitarian situation that resulted from the recent Cyclone Remal and the floods in the northeastern parts of the country. The situation has impacted the well-being and lives of millions of children, women, and the entire population. Response efforts are being hindered by disrupted logistics, communication breakdowns, and coordination issues, leading to delays in delivering water and essential supplies such water purification tablets, education in emergency kits (EIE kits) and dignity kits. Violence and unrest resulted in roadblocks and curfews, restricting access to affected areas and delaying the provision of emergency services. The safety of humanitarian workers is at risk, further limiting their ability to assist, while increased anxiety, fear and mental stress have reduced attendance at awareness sessions and impacted health services seeking by communities. By September 2024, a total of 18.4 million people in Bangladesh have been impacted by cyclone Remal and recurrent floods, leaving an estimated 6.4 million in need of immediate assistance in 29 districts, which accounts for 45 per cent of the 64 total districts. Six months after Cyclone Remal made landfall, the most vulnerable families in Bangladesh continue to struggle to recover from its impacts. In the worst-affected areas, many people are still living in damaged homes, unable to afford repairs. With the onset of winter between December and January, these families are likely to face additional hardships as they contend with cold weather. The cyclone caused significant losses in household income and livelihoods, compounded by a subsequent economic downturn. Damage to standing crops, essential tools, and equipment, along with saline water intrusion, has severely disrupted agricultural production. In some of the hardest-hit areas, access to hygiene, sanitation, and safe drinking water remains extremely limited.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"In Bangladesh, over 800,000 people have been evacuated to safer areas in 16 coastal districts ahead of the cyclone in 9,000 shelters.

Medical assistance and preventive measures are ongoing to curb the disease which is mostly transmitted through contaminated water. The current outbreak in Niger is closely linked to an unclean water supply and hygiene and sanitation facilities for the 240,000 people who are currently displaced in Diffa. This is a particularly vulnerable population that for years has been suffering the consequences of the conflict between Boko Haram and armies in the region. To contain the outbreak, MSF has been working with the Ministry of Health for several weeks. Additionally, MSF has significantly increased its water and sanitation activities in Kitchendi, Garin Wazan and Toumour villages, where around 135,000 people have settled\u2014the vast majority of which are displaced. The organization also distributed water chlorination tablets, soap and new jerrycans for 16,800 families in these villages. So far, more than 27,900 gallons of water have been treated and jerrycans being used in the community have been cleaned to prevent the spread of the disease. There is a risk that the outbreak will intensify. New cases are expected to continue to emerge in new health districts in the region. Diffa region is prone to rapid propagation of the disease due to the prevalent underlying factors, such as limited access to safe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices. The region is inhabited by vulnerable populations, such as refugees, IDPs, and returnees who are at risk of contracting the disease due to their living conditions. The forthcoming rainy season, from June to September, is likely to increase the spread of the disease to neighbouring regions, and will further exacerbate WASH needs among affected populations. As of mid-August, the hepatitis E outbreak in Niger is gradually improving, with a sustained decrease in the number of new cases observed since the second peak was attained in week 26, during which 150 cases were reported. During week 32 (week ending 13 August 2017), 37 new suspected cases were reported, compared with 48 in week 31. The trend of hepatitis E cases in Niger has continued to decrease steadily after the last peak in week 26 (week ending 30 June 2017), with the incidence falling below 40 cases per week. During week 39 (week ending 1 October 2017), a total of 39 new cases and zero deaths were reported, compared to 45 cases reported in week 38. All the new cases originated from Diffa District. Since the beginning of the outbreak on 2 January 2017, a total of 1,955 suspected and confirmed cases including 38 deaths (case fatality rate 1.9%) have been reported, as of 2 October 2017. The cases have been reported from five districts, including Diffa (1,216 cases, 7 deaths), Nguigmi (305 cases, 2 deaths), Bosso (244 cases, 2 deaths), Main\u00e9 Soroa (11 cases), and Goudoumaria (9 cases). Diffa and Bosso have been the most affected districts, accounting for over 90% of the total cases. The last death occurred on 7 July 2017. New cases of Hepatitis E are still being presented and recorded in the region of Diffa. Since the declaration of the epidemic by the Health authorities on the 19 April 2017, a total of 2,035 cases have been declared with 38 deaths recorded. Up to 25 April the mortality rate was 29 per cent dropping to 1.86 per cent by 24 October. As of 29 December, the outbreak continues to improve. The majority of cases have been reported from Diffa, N\u2019Guigmi, and Bosso health districts. Case incidence continues to decline, 11 suspected cases have been reported in week 46.

The increasing trend indicates a risk of further spread without necessary interventions. With the upcoming El Ni\u00f1o and the long rains expected from March to May 2024, there is a likelihood of a rise in cases, potentially affecting more regions. This situation is exacerbated by the current outbreaks in eight regions (Kagera, Ruvuma, Simiyu, Tabora, Shinyanga, Singida, Geita, and Mwanza) with 851 active cases reported since December 23rd, 2023.

The incident occurred in the town known as \\\"El Cayo\\\", the main population center of the municipality and where the municipal offices, health center, banks, and other commercial and government buildings are located. To date, the causes of the fire are still unclear. There was no Fire Department in the affected areas. Therefore, there was not a speedy response to the incident. According to reports from the Permanent Contingency Commission (COPECO), the fire was 100% controlled around 11:00 a.m. on 2 October, thanks to the deployment of firefighters from the near island of Roatan (located between the islands of \u00datila and Guanaja) and the regions near the coast of the country of La Ceiba and Tegucigalpa, including members of the Honduran Naval Force and Air Force, which provided boats and helicopters to quell the spread of the fire.

The worst affected were Jubaland, Hirshabelle and South West states. On 27 April, flash floods inundated roads connecting Dhobley and Afmadow districts and its environs in Jubaland State, temporarily making the roads impassable thereby affecting an estimated 60,000 people in the two districts. The local airstrips in Dhobley and Afmadow were flooded. Moderate rains were also reported in Middle Juba and Gedo region, notably in Doolow, Luuq, and Bualle.

At least 67 of the 95 verified settlements for internally displaced people in Hirshabelle were impacted by the rains, affecting about 39,120 people (6,520 households). The Gu (April to June) heavy rains and flash floods spread to more areas of Somalia and affected at least 203,438 people, including around 37,120 displaced or relocated and nine people killed as of 8 May, according to authorities. The floods destroyed and damaged infrastructure including some 3,080 shelters, 4,702 latrines, three schools and killed at least 100 livestock. Shallow wells were submerged and some destroyed, which in turn, posed a risk of cholera outbreak. Additionally, hectares of agricultural land were inundated by the floods, jeopardizing food security and might lead to an increase in price instability.

Humanitarian partners, working together with the Federal Government of Somalia, continued to support people affected by Gu (April to June) seasonal rains and flash floods, and reached at least 157,000 people with some form of assistance. As of 14 May, the number of people affected by the ongoing rains had risen to 225,759 people including 38,727 people displaced and 9 deaths, according to the authorities. Across Somalia, the heavy rains and flash floods have resulted in the loss of livelihoods, including livestock, cropland, damaged small businesses and destroyed infrastructure including shelter (3,367 destroyed and 870 affected), water sources (29 water points), latrines (5,002), schools (7), and damaged roads.

The rains affected some 268,359 people and killed 10. The number of people displaced significantly rose to 81,000 from 38,700 reported on 19 May after the Shabelle River broke its banks in Belet Weyne district, displacing 42,600 people in Koshin, Haawo taako, Buundoweye, and Howlwadaag areas. At least 9,000 of those displaced in Belet Weyne reportedly returned to their homes and another 30,000 people were expected to return in the next two weeks. Schools in Belet Weyne town re-opened. In Dhobley and Afmadow, Jubaland State, some 24,000 people who were displaced went back to their homes due to prevailing dry conditions.

An Emergency Response Status for drought events in the affected sub-districts was declared by the Regent of Puncak District, effective from 7 June to 7 August 2023. According to Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD District Puncak \u2013 Central Papua), some 7,500 people (1,800 families) are reportedly experiencing hunger as of 29 July. Essential aid, including food items, non-food items and emergency shelter kits have been distributed by the BPBD Puncak district authorities with support from the Indonesian National Army (TNI) and the Ministry of Social Affairs. The Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) estimates that this dry season will persist until September 2023. According to BMKG, climate phenomena recorded in Pacific Ocean waters in May and June of 2023 triggered El Ni\u00f1o starting June, which further causing the region to feel warmer. Anomalies in Pacific Ocean temperatures have been growing, with the index reaching 0.8, concerningly close to the threshold of 1, at which point the El Ni\u00f1o status goes from \u201cWeak\u201d to \u201cModerate\u201d. Currently, trends show a consistent increase and by the end of August El Ni\u00f1o status kept on escalating. BMKG forecasted peak of drought season happens starting August and will last until September. Depending on the area affected, Anomalies in Pacific Ocean temperatures may prolong drought to some extent. Therefore, several areas have already impacted by the drought causing water scarcity since June or beginning of August while on the other hand rain still occurs on several area. While the drought peak is not reaching the peak yet, due to the anomalies, some area may experience drought up until October or November. Moreover, BMKG forecasts indicated a high probability that several Indonesian provinces will see rainfall intensity of around 0-20mm below normal during August and September 2023. BMKG has circulated an early warning of potential drought causing water scarcity, particularly in Java and Bali, and the southern part of Sumatra. While on the field, several areas especially in East Java, Banten and Central Java provinces, already declared drought emergency alert even before the BMKG early warning circulated and water scarcity already reported in the area. On the other hand, drought season has impacted crop production in West Papua and affecting food security in the area. Based on PMI situation reports and other resources such as social media, news and articles, water scarcity has been broadly reported. Based on secondary data review and situation at the field, there are approximately 1.2 million people affected by the drought. The number would escalate as drought will last up until September to October according to BKMG forecast. Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) reported 1,185 disasters between July and September 2023, of which majority are drought related. This number is significantly higher compared to the same period in 2022. According to the National Food Agency (NFA), more than half of all provinces in Indonesia were considered food secure by September 2023. Out of 34 provinces, 22 provinces were categorized as stable. 12 provinces were being monitored for possible deterioration for its food security and nutrition situation, compared to 3 last year. The National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) predicted that the ongoing El Ni\u00f1o conditions and its resulting climate conditions over Indonesia is likely to have implications on rice planting and production, even with the regular start of rainy season in November 2023. Additionally, delayed onset of the rainy season could potentially result in reduced rice production by late 2023 and early 2024. According to BMKG, starting in March 2024, the El Ni\u00f1o index will continue to weaken towards a neutral level until the end of the year. Based on the modeling, more and more areas, especially the northern part of Indonesia, will start to experience rainfall or even heavy rainfall. As the phenomenon continues, rainfall, in theory, cannot be the sole indicator of the end of El Ni\u00f1o. Thus, further forecasts will be published based on monthly weather and climate monitoring throughout Indonesia.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Essential aid, including food items, non-food items and emergency shelter kits have been distributed by the BPBD Puncak district authorities with support from the Indonesian National Army (TNI) and the Ministry of Social Affairs.\",\n        \"affected_countries\": [\"Indonesia\"],\n        \"sources\": [\"OCHA\", \"IFRC\", \"WFP\"],\n        \"language\": \"English\"\n    }\n}", "https://reliefweb.int/disaster/eq-2002-000015-tjk": "{\n    \"https://reliefweb.int/disaster/eq-2002-000015-tjk\": {\n        \"disaster_title\": \"Tajikistan: Earthquake - Jan 2002\",\n        \"disaster_type\": [\"Earthquake\"],\n        \"date\": \"2002-01-09\",\n        \"disaster_description\": \"An earthquake measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale struck an area 100 km east of Dushanbe at 11:45 on 9 January.

The 2023-2024 El Ni\u00f1o has been one of the strongest on record, bringing below-average rainfall between October 2023 and February 2024 in southern and central Mozambique, and average to above-average rainfall to the northern part of the country. This disruption continues to impact agriculture and rural livelihoods. Between November 2023 and February 2024, typically the rainy season in Mozambique, the southern and central regions of the country experienced persistent dryness and unusually high temperatures, and many areas received less than half of their typical rainfall. These events in turn led to deteriorating vegetation conditions and crop wilting in parts of the central provinces.

In Metro Manila, home to 13.5 million people, heavy rainfall caused urban flooding, road closures, and significant disruptions. By 10am local time, the water level in the Marikina River surpassed 18 meters, triggering mandatory evacuation of numerous families, with water levels reaching over 20.7 meters by 7pm. In one area in Quezon City, it was recorded that 458 mm of rain fell within a 24-hour period. In comparison, during Typhoon Ondoy in September 2009, the recorded rainfall over the same duration was 455 mm. Tropical cyclone Gaemi, which has intensified into a Super Typhoon, is expected to make landfall over northern Taiwan before exiting the Philippine Area of Responsibility by noon on 25 July. Moderate to intense rainfall is still expected to continue over the western portion of Luzon until 26 July according to the Philippines weather agency PAGASA. Super Typhoon Gaemi (local name Carina) has been downgraded to a typhoon as it crossed Taiwan and exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on 25 July. The storm, combined with the effects of the southwest monsoon, brought heavy rainfall to the western section of Luzon, including Metro Manila. Flooding incidents have been reported in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Due to the intense amount of rainfall, floodgates were opened for Ipo and Binga dams located in Central and Northern Luzon respectively, which further contributed to flooding incidents. In addition, La Mesa Dam, located near Metro Manila, reached its spilling level, but has since returned to normal levels. Weather is expected to improve in the coming days, but the state weather bureau PAGASA reports heavy to intense rainfall is expected over the western portion of Luzon until 27 July. Tropical cyclone GAEMI made landfall on 25 July in the mid-morning (UTC) over the eastern coast of Fujian province as a tropical storm and is expected to move north-west over the province and dissipate over the Jiangxi province on 27 July. According to the media, in China, more than 240,000 people were temporarily evacuated in the province of Fujian and more than 5,000 rescuers were deployed in the cities of Fuzhou, Putian and Ningde, and Pingtan County. In Taiwan, three people died following its passage on 24 July. In the Philippines, more than 1.3 million people have been affected (in combination with the southwest monsoon) and over 800,000 have been displaced. Tropical cyclone GAEMI affected northern Philippines (22-23 July), northern Taiwan (24 July), and southeastern China (25 July), causing casualties and damage. Taiwan reported ten fatalities, while in China 15 died in a Hunan province landslide, and 3,832 were evacuated due to a river dike breach. In the Philippines, the Department of Social Welfare and Development of the Philippines (DSWD) reports 273,757 displaced, 3,617,365 affected across 11 regions (particularly in northern Philippines) and 1,256 houses damaged or destroyed. Typhoon Gaemi has brought significant flooding and destruction across nine provinces in China, severely affecting Henan, Hunan, Jilin, Liaoning, and Yunnan provinces. In Henan Province, the typhoon resulted in the deaths of four individuals, with three others reported missing, and affected approximately 87,000 people. In Liaoning Province, more than 14,500 residents were relocated following an orange alert, indicating a high risk of severe weather. In response to the impending heavy rainfall and potential flooding, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters activated a Level-IV emergency response for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region on 29 July. To bolster local relief efforts, the Ministry of Emergency Management (MEM) deployed uncrewed aerial vehicles to Hunan Province and allocated disaster relief materials valued at 4.41 million yuan (approximately USD 618,000) to Liaoning Province.

The combined effects of the southwest monsoon and Tropical Cyclone Gaemi (local name Carina) have brought heavy to intense rainfall across the Philippines, affecting over 4.8 million people nationwide. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reports 39 fatalities (14 confirmed and 25 under validation), nine injuries, and six people missing. Approximately 108,000 people are currently displaced and housed in 557 evacuation centers.

On 14 May, 10 people were rescued from two cars that were caught in floods in Razavi Khorasan Province. In Ardabil Province, more than 200 mm of snow and rain fell since late March. This increased the water level of rivers and caused flooding in some areas. In Yazd Province, floods damaged agricultural infrastructure such as farm roads, aqueducts and water storage pools. Agricultural lands in Urmia Province have also been damaged by hail and floods. The Iranian Government has allocated $80 million to Golestan Province for the reconstruction of infrastructure that was affected by floods. On 20 May, heavy rainfalls and floods caused damages in wide areas. They also caused damage in agricultural areas and canals, which resulted in power outages. In eastern Gilan Province, heavy rainfalls damaged waterlogging and caused flooding. This hindered the access to the region. In Isfahan Province, the local IRCS teams rescued 52 people after the floods on 20 May.

Some 7,000 affected people have moved to Hantiwadaag village in Jowhar. According to partners, an estimated 13,000 have been affected by flooding. In Hiraan region, thousands of people have been affected after the Shabelle River burst its banks and its inlets overflowed into parts of Belet Weyne town and several riverine villages inundating houses and crops. Overall, more than 427,000 people have been affected as of 26 April and of these nearly 175,000 have been displaced as a result of the flash and river flooding in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region, according to data collected by humanitarian partners. Flash and river flooding has so far affected an estimated 630,000 people. More than 214,800 of these have been displaced from their homes following the heavy rains received across the country in April, according to the UNHCR-led Protection & Return Monitoring Network (PRMN). An estimated 772,500 people have been affected by the flooding and more than 229,000 are displaced, according to PRMN.

In these areas, several roads are now impassible and trade flows are expected to slow, driving food prices higher. Cases of AWD/Cholera are expected to rise as flood waters stagnate and remaining clean drinking water sources are compromised.

According to SWALIM, the forecast for the coming week calls for clear weather, with the exception of coastal areas of Lower Shabelle and Lower Juba in Jubaland State. This signifies the gradual end of the 2018 Gu rainy season, which has seen above-average rainfall during April and early May. Some river breakages have not yet been closed in the mid-lower parts of the Shabelle river and therefore there remains a moderate risk of flooding.

In the north, three days of unstoppable rain caused the Indus River to swell, creating a massive body of water that moved from the Himalayas, southwards to the Arabian Sea. The disaster became more destructive than the Haiti earthquake and the Japan tsunami combined. The monsoon rains that lashed Pakistan from the end of July through August 2010 caused the country\u2019s worst flooding since 1929. The northwest of the country, particularly the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was the first area to be affected. The situation deteriorated with the passing weeks as flooding spread to two other major food-producing provinces, the Punjab and Sindh, both densely populated, in August and September. Out of a population of 168 million, at least 20 million people were affected by the floods, losing their homes and livelihoods, mainly across the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh. The floods also affected people in Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-Administered-Kashmir. More than 1700 people died, more than 7 million were left homeless and at least 1.8 million homes were destroyed. Over 2.4 million hectares of standing crops were submerged, and 450,000 heads of livestock lost. Within a period of one and a half months, 78 districts out of Pakistan\u2019s 141 districts were affected, and as of 24 October 2010, the government\u2019s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported that there had been 1,985 deaths and 2,946 people injured by the floods. Out of the estimated 22.2 million hectares of agricultural land, almost two million hectares were destroyed in the floods, threatening severe food shortages in the coming months. More than 400 hospitals and health clinics were damaged or destroyed, as well as education facilities, power and transmission lines, telecommunication networks and industrial infrastructure. In Punjab, the breadbasket of Pakistan, experienced a combination of flash floods in the mountains and highly destructive river flooding in agricultural areas. An estimated six million people were affected across eleven districts. More than 500,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. And more than 1.85 million acres of arable land was washed away. The most severely affected districts were: Muzzafargarh, Rajanpur, Mianwali, R.I. Khan, Layyah, D.G. Khan, and Bhakkar. The direct impact of the floods has been the most protracted in Sindh. Close to half of the rural population was affected, with millions evacuated or forced to flee. At the peak of the crisis vast swathes of the province were left underwater, critical because the majority of the people rely on agriculture for their survival. More than seven million people were affected and more than 875,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.

Preliminary reports indicate flooding and wind damage as Eta continues its projected westward path over northern Nicaragua. The United States\u2019 National Hurricane Center (NHC) projects that Eta will cross into central Honduras by midday on 4 November and then reach eastern Guatemala and Belize on 5 November at night, passing over northern El Salvador during this time, before turning north-east back out into the Caribbean Sea by 7 November. Eta has downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves into eastern and central Honduras at 11 km/h with windspeeds of 65 km/h. Despite Eta\u2019s decreased intensity and lower windspeeds, Nicaragua continues to take on moderate, but persistent, rainfall throughout much of the country, with meteorological forecasts citing more than 600mm through 8 November. Eta\u2019s slow movement and ongoing impact, coupled with the remote locations of areas along Nicaragua\u2019s north-eastern Caribbean shores that have taken the brunt of Eta\u2019s effects, are limiting full and complete evaluations. Eta is expected to continue weakening as it interacts with mountainous terrain in Nicaragua and Honduras, potentially weakening to a tropical depression by 4 November at night. Nicaragua\u2019s National Disaster Prevention System (SINAPRED) reports that Eta, now on its way out of Nicaragua, has thus far caused two deaths due to a landslide in the mining area of Bonanza. Preliminary reports cite material damages, uprooted trees, interruptions to power supply, flooding and blocked roads and affected bridges. Official sources report that there are 30,000 people sheltered across 48 installations, including churches, schools, shelters and family homes. After almost a month since the landfall of Eta, Nicaragua estimates over 3 million people affected, as well as significant infrastructure damages in 56 municipalities, including approximately 43,000 damaged / destroyed homes. The Government response continues to focus on restoring basic service access for water, power and telecommunications. Eta\u2019s rains are also causing flooding, damages and humanitarian impacts in Honduras, with the Permanent Commission for Contingencies (COPECO) reporting more than 3,480 people affected and 1 death as of 12:00am local time 4 November. Honduran Armed Forces report supporting the evacuation of more than 2,500 people, indicating that 1,340 are in shelters. Material damages include nearly 350 affected homes, as well as several road blockages that have cut off 41 communities. With Eta crossing into Honduras, outer band rains began falling over Guatemala in the past 24 hours, triggering flooding in several areas. Per the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED), the rains and subsequent flooding and landslides have thus far affected 27,770 people across the departments of Alta Verapaz, Pet\u00e9n, Quich\u00e9 and Solol\u00e1. In El Salvador, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) reports that Eta is causing high winds of up to 30 km/h in parts of the capital of San Salvador that have already led to fallen trees and debris. The National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) anticipates that Eta\u2019s major threat is heavy rainfall and flooding, with some locations across the country already taking on 50mm of rain. NEMO expects rainfall to last until 9-11 November, posing a high flood risk across Belize. In Costa Rica, the National Emergency Commission (CNE) reports that hazardous rains related to Eta have affected 79 communities, mostly in the north-western Pacific coast. CNE, who have deployed response teams to affected areas, adds that there are 500 people in 16 shelters, a number they expect to rise as persistent rainfall continues to affect the country. The National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC) reports that rains related to Eta have damaged some 213 homes in western and central Panama communities. Additionally, landslides in the north-western Ng\u00e4be Bugl\u00e9 indigenous territory have affected about 1,000 people. Heavy rain due to the influence of Hurricane ETA affected the southern States of Mexico (particularly Chiapas, Tabasco and Veracruz) over the past few days, causing floods, triggering landslides and leading to casualties and damage. Three weeks after Hurricane Eta struck Central America, authorities continue assessing the damages and gathering information on the affected communities. As of 25 November, the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) reported that there were 109 families, including 258 children still in shelters.

So far 63 people are reported dead, of which 33 are laboratory-confirmed (1.55 per cent mortality). During this same period, 12 departments (66.6 per cent of the entire country) reported high incidence of dengue. In view of this scenario, on 14 June the Government of Honduras declared a Health Emergency in these departments. The most affected departments are Cort\u00e9s (4,200 cases), Yoro (1,083 cases), Olancho (855 cases) and Santa B\u00e1rbara (643 cases). If we add the 1,042 cases reported in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan Region, we see that 75 per cent of all cases reported to date are in north-western Honduras (8,647 / 11,436 cases). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Honduras presents 77.5 per cent of dengue cases reported in America. The Government is allocating more than US$10 million for public institutions to respond to the dengue outbreak currently gripping Honduras. Additionally, the Government will allocate more than $2 million to affected municipalities for dengue response. As of epidemiological week 29, Honduras has seen 33,840 cases, with 8,662 cases of severe dengue and 150 deaths. Of Honduras\u2019 32 public hospitals, 26 are overrun with cases; officials have postponed planned operations to manage the volume of cases. El Salvador reported 8,893 cases so far this year, a 220 per cent increase from the 2,700 cases registered in the same reporting period in 2018. There are nine deaths currently under investigation for suspected links to the disease. Hospitalizations are also up with 2,241 in 2019 compared to 643 in 2018. The Ministry is also reporting an 88 per cent increase in Zika cases and 64 per cent increase in Chikungunya cases. Guatemala has, as of 13 July, some 8,370 cases of dengue. Health authorities note that there have only been 38 cases of severe dengue, resulting in 27 deaths, including 18 children. Although the cases through 13 July are nearly double the cases in 13 July 2017, they are well below the peak of 19,700 cases through 13 July in 2014. Most cases are in the departments of Escuintla, Huehuetenango, Izabal, Quetzaltenango and San Marcos. Central America is experiencing an outbreak of dengue fever since April 2019, with approximately 10,000 suspected cases reported across the region so far. The highest number is reported in Nicaragua with 49,929 suspected cases (of which 1,862 are laboratory-confirmed) and in Honduras with 34,840 cases (of which 58 are laboratory-confirmed deaths). A significant increase in dengue cases has been reported in Paraguay in recent weeks. According to PAHO's report for Epidemiology Week No. 7 (EW7 until February 15), dengue cases have increased to 106,127 suspected cases, 20,837 new cases (EW7) and 20 people who have died from the disease.

On 17-18 May, rain with thunderstorms is forecast over Central, Sabaragamuwa, Uva, Eastern and North-Central Provinces. The southwest monsoon and activation of a depression which was later developed to tropical cyclone \u201cTauktae\u201d over the southeast Arabian sea triggered heavy rainfall in Sri Lanka from 12 to 14 May 2021. Western, South and Sabaragamuawa provinces of Sri Lanka were worst affected. Sri Lanka\u2019s Department of Meteorology has reported a maximum rainfall up to 336 millimeters in the Western province particularly in Kalutara district. During this period five deaths have been reported in Gampaha, Galle and Kegalle districts. Even though rain has stopped, the affected low-lying areas are still inundated with floods in the nine districts in five provinces and have caused damages to residential areas. Agricultural lands and standing crops have also been inundated and damaged as well as the infrastructures. Sri Lanka Metrological department predicts heavy rainfall on 22-25 May and the possibility of continuation of flooding, which may increase the impact and further exacerbate the situation with further reduction of coping capacity of vulnerable households in the affected areas. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) situation report as of 17 May, 43,701 people (11,247 families) have been affected across 9 districts, and 5 deaths were reported.

A total of 29 evacuation centres/Safety locations are activated and 377 families (1,658 people) are located in these centres. Eight road embankment failure incidents were reported from Kegalle District which caused two fatalities. The DMC is coordinating the national response efforts. Water sources of the area have been contaminated due to heavy rain and the overflow of sewerage pits/septic tanks are open to public water facilities. Therefore, DMC reveal that there is a need for drinking water, wells and area cleaning. Due to activation of South-West monsoon winds, very heavy rains were received during 2 June to 5 June, and most parts of the South Western region received more than 300mm rainfall within 24 hours and maximum reported was 346mm in Dummalasooriya on 3 June (Puttalam district). As a result due to heavy rainfall, strong winds and few landslides a total of 245,212 people (60,674 families) got affected in 10 districts, since 2 May. Furthermore, 14 deaths were reported, and two persons suffered minor injuries while two persons were missing due to floods and cutting failures. A total amount of 15,658 people (3,520 families) have been highly impacted and evacuated to 72 safety centres set up to assist the displaced. Most of these safety centres are in the Colombo (32), Gampaha (16), Kalutara (10) and Ratnapura (10) districts. Some 3,397 of these displaced people are residing with relatives or friends houses. Heavy rain and strong winds have been affecting parts of western Sri Lanka since 3 June, causing floods and landslides, which have resulted in casualties.

Early warnings for landslide events have been issued for Western and Sabaragamuwa (southern Sri Lanka) Provinces, while on 7-8 June, heavy rain is forecast over the same Provinces. Heavy rain and strong winds continue to affect particularly western and south-western Sri Lanka, causing floods and landslides, which have resulted in an increased human impact. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), 20 people have died and five individuals remain injured. The number of total affected people stands at 176,419 and up to 7,989 individuals have been displaced to either evacuation centres or relatives' houses across ten Districts of Sri Lanka. Damage has been reported to more than 1,100 buildings. On 9-10 June, heavy rain is forecast over Western, Sabaragamuwa (southern Sri Lanka) and North-western Provinces. As of 11 June, floodwater receded considerably, about 90% the families have returned to either their own places or staying with host families. Since 98% houses are partially damaged people prefer to stay in their own places while working on repairs. Heavy rain and strong winds have been affecting the Central Province of Sri Lanka, causing floods and resulting in casualties and damage. According to the Disaster Management Centre of Sri Lanka, one person died and another has been injured in Kandy District.

The orange alert means that government institutions are planning for an impending disaster. Continued rainfall has been forecast for the first quarter of 2017. Rains are expected to continue, which will increase the number of people affected. The risk of vector- and water-borne diseases is particularly high, as both cholera and malaria are endemic and outbreaks recurring. In Malawi, due to La Ni\u00f1a weather phenomenon since the onset of the rainy season, many districts have received normal to above normal rainfall triggering flash floods in some of the districts. Between 4 and 10 February, heavy rain caused the worst flooding in Salima District in four Traditional Authorities of Ndindi, Pemba, Kambwiri and Maganga. A total of 35,304 people have been affected. 7,216 people have been displaced and are homeless and are dwelling in school blocks. On 15 February, Tropical Cyclone Dineo made landfall near Inhambane, Southern Mozambique. Shortly after, the storm evolved from severe tropical storm to Category III Tropical Cyclone and was reclassified as Ex-Dineo. The initial report indicated 3 deaths and 4 injured, damaged Infrastructure (electricity, and roads) as a result of the storm in the affected areas. The National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) projects that urban flooding in small villages and cities may affect 200,000 people over the next 7 days and the following river basins would be at risk of flooding. Between January and March 2017, Zimbabwe experienced severe flooding across 37 districts of the country, which damaged local infrastructure, livelihoods, transportation routes, and homes. Between 18 and 23 February 2017, Botswana was hit by the tropical depression, ex-Dineo which caused significant flooding across the country. As a result of inundations, bridges have collapsed, roads have been closed, and health facilities have been flooded. The Government has closed schools in some districts to reduce the risk of children drowning, however in some districts children must still travel long distances to school in sometimes hazardous flood conditions.

This slow-onset disaster is unique to Mongolia and results from summer droughts followed by heavy snowfalls and extreme cold, leading to insufficient grazing pastures and hence underfed animals resulting in increased livestock mortality. As of 30th December 2023, over 90% of the country has been affected by extreme Dzud conditions, with 160 soums across 20 provinces being identified as high-risk areas. Over 258,000 people, including 100,000 children (51,000 girls and 49,000 boys) are affected due to roads blocked by snow, preventing children from accessing vital health, nutrition, education and protective services. Herder families, who are most directly impacted by the Dzud, often have to leave their children in the care of relatives or at boarding schools, increasing protection risks and causing psychological stress. As a result of the Dzud, the number of livestock losses increased from 49,000 in November 2023 to 284,242 by 26 January 2024. The Otor Movement is a nomadic practice of domestic herders migrating to seek pasture: From early November 2023, 18,859 herder families (67,892 people) have been on the Otor Movement. As of January 2024, 7,570 families moved to the state-protected area (the Mongolian government is using its last pasture resort, where settlement is prohibited because there are endangered plants and animals under State protection), 2,322 families moved to other provinces, 4,303 families moved within their province, 2,907 moved to the border, 1,047 moved to the provincial border (in and out between 2 provinces), and only 710 families moved in soum borders. While the Otor movement is beneficial for livestock, it requires tremendous efforts from herder families to frequently relocate, forcing them to live in roughly built shelters and being isolated from basic services. The intensity of the dzud is impacting those on the Otor Movement more than in previous years, and the number of people on the Otor Movement is higher than in previous years. The current white and iron dzud in Mongolia has resulted in a critical situation, with 90% of the country facing high risk. The herding communities are struggling with inadequate feed and skyrocketing feed prices, leading to heightened vulnerabilities. The increasing severity of weather conditions further exacerbates the crisis, underscoring the urgent need for humanitarian assistance and sustainable solutions to support Mongolia's rural communities and traditional livelihoods. According to the national Emergency Operations Center (EOC), there are 13,573 households currently residing in snow blocked areas, as of 18 February 2024. Between November 2023 to February 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 150,500 people, including 62,500 children (31,500 girls and 31,000 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 89 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 1,430 people trapped by heavy snow. According to EOC, 9 casualties due to snowstorms, including 1 child, have been reported. The number of livestock perished reached 667,841 as of 19 February 2024, which is significantly higher compared to past years\u2019 data. However, the peak of livestock mortality is yet to come and expected to occur from late February to April 2024. As of 22 February, media report one fatality and more than 1.5 million livestock losses across the country. Essential aids have been provided since 19 February. The livestock mortality rate reportedly reached 4.8 per cent by 29 February, representing some 3.1 million heads of livestock \u2013 nearly a million more livestock deaths than a week ago and nearly 6.5 times as many livestock deaths as this time last year. Livestock deaths are expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks, potentially exceeding the national-level 6 per cent disaster threshold. At the province (aimag) level, the most severe impacts this season have been recorded in the eastern regions, with four aimags already exceeding the threshold \u2013 Sukhbaatar (24.4 per cent), Dornogovi (14.7 per cent), Govisumber (11.2 per cent), and Hentii (9.6 per cent). With around 190,000 herder households grappling with insufficient feed, soaring prices and heightened vulnerabilities, the worsening weather conditions are exacerbating a crisis, highlighting the urgent need for support and sustainable interventions to bolster rural communities and traditional livelihoods in Mongolia. According to the Dzud Map produced by NAMEM on 26 February 2024, 76 per cent of the country is currently affected by white and ice/Iron Dzud types. Several additional key factors have contributed to the escalation of the Dzud to an exceptional level this winter: numerous blizzards since November 2023, extensive snow coverage across the country, and fluctuating temperatures with periods of intense cold/freezing, followed by warm phases/snow melting, and then refreezing, leaving no grazing options for livestock (sheep, cows, horses, and camels). Consequently, hay and fodder stocks had to be utilised a few months earlier than in usual winters. The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), established by the government of Mongolia last December, has reported a rapid increase in livestock mortality from the second half of February 2024, with the latest official figures as of 14 March 2024 indicating over 4,7 million dead animals (compared to 612,000 dead animals on 21 February). This represents 7 per cent of the national livestock (up from 0.94 per cent on 21 February). While the numbers are increasing fast, this situation is already twice as critical as last year's Dzud, and the government estimates that this year will be far more severe than the worst Dzud recorded in 2010. On 14 February 2024, the Government of Mongolia passed a resolution declaring a heightened readiness level until 15 May due to the severe Dzud affecting the country nationwide (priority support and involvement in crisis management, at all governmental levels). According to EOC figures, as of the end of February, 185,937 herder households, constituting 75 per cent of all herder households, have been directly or indirectly affected by the Dzud\u2019s impacts. About 100,000 herder families are considered the most vulnerable households. As of 7 March 2024, 1,344 herders have lost their entire livestock, and 18,859 herder families are currently on the Otor movement (a nomadic winter coping mechanism used in past years by herder communities in Mongolia to provide livestock access to pasture). Between November 2023 and March 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 114 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 3,757 people, including 721 children, trapped by heavy snow. The situation has escalated significantly compared to previous years, with March 2024 witnessing conditions twice as severe as the last dzud event, and the worst since 2010. Current livestock mortality rates have already soared to 8.1% of 64.7 million livestock, with 2,257 herder households having lost more than 70% of their livestock. The severity of the situation has prompted a revision of the Dzud Response Plan for 2023/2024, which complements the Government of Mongolia\u2019s planned response. The plan revised by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) now aims to deliver immediate and life-saving assistance to 76,000 people out of the 200,000 people in need identified by the HCT through a coordinated approach with early warning and early action to respond to needs triggered by the Dzud. Health concerns are escalating, with restricted food availability leading to nutritional deficiencies among herder households. The remote location of many herder families, combined with a lack of fuel and prioritization of livestock over healthcare, severely limits access to medical services, which are available at the provincial and soum levels. The need to dispose of more than five million animal carcasses is urgent, as yellow floods are expected with spring temperatures set to melt an exceptional amount of snow this year. The government has begun to safely bury animal carcasses through collection points along roads, with areas near rivers being prioritized to contain public health risks. Between November 2023 and April 2024, Mongolia experienced the harshest dzud in the last fifty years, with severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affecting over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys). Twenty people, including two children, have lost their lives due to severe blizzard. The dzud has mostly affected herder households, whose main/sole income source for livelihood is livestock. As of 25 April 2024, 4957 herder households had lost more than 70 per cent of their livestock and the country has lost 7.1 million livestock, amounting to 11.1 per cent of the total. Despite the temperature beginning to rise and the spring months ahead, dzud conditions persist and the loss of livestock is expected to continue in the coming months. Although the severe winter condition subsided, livestock that had been exhausted and starved for long period continued to perish well into May. By mid-May 2024, the number of livestock loss reached 7.2 million, amounting to 11.6 percent of the total. The impact of the dzud impact on the herder households continues to affect the livelihood, mental health, wellbeing, nutritional and education needs of over 24,000 children. Amid the dzud recovery efforts, there is a high risk of flooding in central and eastern parts of Mongolia, posing increasing challenges for the vulnerable population in flood-prone areas. Official estimates indicate that about 7.9 million heads of livestock perished due to the 2023/24 Dzud, with the highest losses occurring in Sukhbaatar, Khentii, Arkhangai, Tuv and Dornogovi provinces (locally known as aimags) located in the eastern and central parts of the country. The death toll accounts for 12.3 percent of the national herd, significantly exceeding the average mortality rate recorded during the same period in the previous five years and is the highest level since 2010. The loss of livestock has a direct negative effect on the income of a large number of people in the country as over a quarter of the total population is engaged in livestock\u2011rearing activities. Reduced income and high prices of staple foods are expected to erode the purchasing power of most vulnerable herder households, constraining their access to food. In addition to the Dzud impacts, the Emergency Operation Center (EOC) addressed the high risk of \u201cyellow\u201d floods due to accumulated snowfall and livestock carcasses in Dzud-affected regions by the end of May 2024. However, NAMEM issued warning for potential floods during summertime from high precipitation levels forecasted. From June to August 2024, heavy rains and floods affected several Dzud-affected regions including Uvurkhangai, Tuv, Zavkhan, and Umnugobi, directly and indirectly impacting over 1,300 people and leading to the loss of 22,000 livestock. Furthermore, a series of wildfire struck the region most affected by the dzud including Khentii, Dornod, Sukhbaatar provinces between 11-16 October, directly affecting 21 families, resulting in the loss of two children and 1,000 livestock, and burning 16 hectares of pastureland. These recurring hazards continue to compound the difficulties faced by Dzud-affected herder communities. As of 25 October, NAMEM has issued seasonal weather forecasts for October 2024 to January 2025 and MoFALI has updated pasture carrying capacity estimates and September update on the winter preparation for 2024/2025. According to NAMEM forecast, the temperatures may fluctuate between October, November, December 2024, and January 2025, with warmer conditions anticipated for October and November but colder-than-average temperatures predicted for December 2024 and January 2025, raising concerns for a possible ice/iron Dzud situation.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 89 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 1,430 people trapped by heavy snow.

The outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria continues to propagate, with new states being affected weekly. Between 1 January and 2 February 2020, a cumulative total of 1 226 suspected cases were reported in Nigeria. Among these, a total of 365 confirmed cases were recorded from 74 local government areas (LGAs) in 23 states. The Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria continues, with a high incidence of cases and deaths reported and new states being affected. Between 1 January and 23 February 2020, a cumulative total of 2 633 suspected cases were reported across Nigeria. Of these, a total of 689 cases coming from 115 local government areas (LGAs) in 27 states were confirmed, Among the 689 confirmed cases, 118 deaths have occurred, giving a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 17.1% among confirmed cases, which is relatively lower compared to the CFR for the same period in 2019 (21.8%). The Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria has greatly improved, with only a few sporadic cases being reported. The disease trend has been steadily declining since week 7 (2020) when a peak of 115 confirmed cases (with 18 deaths) were reported. However, in week 16 (week ending 19 April 2020), a total of six new confirmed cases (with no deaths) have been reported, compared to 10 confirmed cases reported in week 15. These new cases reported in week 16 came from three states: Ondo (3), Gombe (2) and Taraba (1). There were six case-patients admitted to treatment centres during the reporting week, and 275 contacts under follow up. No new healthcare worker was reported affected in week 16. From weeks 1-16 of 2020, a cumulative total of 4 475 suspected Lassa fever cases has been reported, of which 969 were laboratory confirmed, including 188 deaths (case fatality ratio among confirmed cases 19.2%).\",\n        \"interventions\": \"With the outbreak confirmed, WHO intensified its technical assistance to State and Federal authorities in investigation and response to the outbreak.

Malawi, which now has an estimated 3.3 million people in Crisis or Emergency (IPC phase 3 and 4), and Zimbabwe, where nearly 2.4 million people are in Crisis or Emergency, have the highest numbers of severely food insecure people in the region. Meanwhile, three districts in Zimbabwe and two districts in Madagascar were classified in Emergency (IPC phase 4) at the outset of the lean season, as a result of extreme loss of livelihood assets. There are also pockets of people facing Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4) in Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique. Since the start of the 2018/19 cropping season in October, anomalous dry conditions have developed across parts of Southern Africa, with more intense moisture deficits registered in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, in addition to the western parts of Madagascar. Although there are a few months remaining in the cropping season, with the main harvest period usually commencing in April, the impact of the reduced rains is expected to have caused a contraction in the area planted and lowered yield prospects, particularly in the aforementioned areas. Heavier rainfall since mid\u2011December provided some respite and helped to alleviate moisture deficits, but concurrently resulted in localized flooding in parts of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Approximately 10.8 million people were facing severe food insecurity in Southern Africa as 2018 came to an end. In Eswatini, the estimated number of people facing Crisis (IPC phase 3) or worse food insecurity more than doubled from 120,000 in October to nearly 250,000 in December. In Zimbabwe, where 2.4 million people in rural areas were severely food insecure, the deteriorating economic situation caused sharp price increases and hampered access to food and agricultural inputs. Shortages of basic food commodities in formal markets, including cooking oil, sugar and bread, were reported, especially in remote areas. In Mozambique, more than 1.78 million people were in IPC phase 3 or above across the country, of whom 814,000 people in five provinces were prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance. Further attacks by non-state armed actors were reported in Cabo Delgado province in November, increasing food security and malnutrition concerns. Meanwhile, in Madagascar, a Flash Appeal was launched to galvanize funding for rapid response in the Grand Sud region, where 890,000 people are severely food insecure. FEWS NET anticipates the next lean season will most likely start atypically early in August/September in several areas of the region, and households will have limited purchasing power due to lower incomes. Additionally, household access to milk will be lower than normal driven by poor livestock body conditions. Consequently, atypically high levels of acute food insecurity are likely during the 2019/20 lean season in most countries across the region, except in Madagascar, Malawi, and northern Mozambique. Atypically high needs will also be driven by conflict in DRC and poor macroeconomic conditions in Zimbabwe. Although outcomes are not expected to be as severe as those following the 2015/16 drought, humanitarian partners should prepare for a likely earlier than normal start to the 2019/20 lean season and higher than normal food assistance needs during this time. President Hage Geingob [of Namibia] yesterday declared the current drought affecting 23 arid and semi-arid counties and pockets of other areas a national disaster. Since 2013, most parts of Namibia recorded below normal rainfall, thereby leaving the grazing land exhausted and with little recovery. An estimated 41.2 million people in 13 SADC Member States are food insecure this year. When comparing the 11 Member States that provided data last year, food insecurity increased by 28%. It is also 7.4% higher than it was during the severe El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought of 2016/17. The overall food security situation in the region is deteriorating and the number of severely food insecure people is rising in some countries, reaching a peak between October 2019 and March 2020. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes prevail in cyclone affected areas of Mozambique and Zimbabwe and areas significantly affected by the drought and the deteriorating macro-economic context in Zimbabwe. Emergency (IPC 4) outcomes prevail in parts of Southern Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique and Eswatini. Poor crop performance due to variable and late rainfall affected significant portions of Lesotho, Eswatini, southern Madagascar, and southern Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, while the impact of cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused damage and destruction to harvests in eastern Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, and central and north Mozambique. A record 45 million people across the 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) will be severely food insecure in the next six months, United Nations food agencies have warned. There are more than 11 million people now experiencing \u201ccrisis\u201d or \u201cemergency\u201d levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4 in nine Southern African countries: Angola, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, Eswatini and Lesotho. The UN food agencies are escalating their responses across the nine countries, planning to assist more than 11 million people by mid-2020. In addition to addressing urgent food and nutrition needs, they will help smallholder farmers boost production and reduce losses, manage precious soil and water resources in a sustainable way and embrace climate-smart agricultural practices, better access to inputs, credit and markets, and spearhead vaccination campaigns to contain livestock disease. The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has welcomed a US$3.39 million contribution from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to help meet the immediate food needs of drought-affected people in Zambia. The US support, confirmed in December 2019, comes at a moment of increasing needs, after drought and prolonged dry spells have left 2.3 million people severely food insecure and in need of assistance. Through this funding, WFP will deliver 2,380 MT of pulses to complement the Government\u2019s maize for three months, giving 255,000 drought-affected people across the country the food and nutritional assistance they need. A record 45 million Southern Africans are food insecure as the region enters the peak of the lean season (January-March 2020). Between October 2019 and March 2020, an estimated 430,000 people are facing severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3+) and require urgent humanitarian action. More than 4.34 million people in rural Zimbabwe are acutely food insecure facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse from February-June 2020. That is equivalent to 45% of the country\u2019s rural population. This includes over 1.04 million people facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity, with Hwange, Kariba and Binga districts being the most vulnerable. According to the results of the IPC, around 26% of Lesotho\u2019s population (380,000 people) are facing high food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) and above from July to September 2020 and require urgent humanitarian action. This includes around 33,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 350,000 people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). In the current period, seven districts are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3) with the exception of Butha-Buthe, Leribe and Berea, where around 560,000 people are classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and require support to maintain their livelihoods. Between October 2020 and March 2021, Zambia\u2019s food security situation is expected to deteriorate, as this coincides with the lean season, when more households will rely on the market for food. It is projected that about 1.98 million people (29% of the analysed population) will be facing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. By the end of the year, severe food insecurity was affecting 13.6 million people across 11 countries, and this will rise during the lean season (January to March 2021). In the Grand Sud of Madagascar, over 900,000 people faced severe food insecurity from October to December due to back-to-back droughts, compounded by COVID-19 and displacements due to the growing insecurity related to cattle raiding. Hunger will increase and affect 1.14 million from January to April 2021. In Mozambique, conflict in Cabo Delgado Province\u2014which had displaced more than 500,000 people by end-October\u2014and drought in the semi-arid southern and central areas of the country drove Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of food insecurity. In Zimbabwe, 2.6 million people were severely food insecure from October to December 2020 due to the prevailing economic situation and erratic rainfall, and 3.4 million people are projected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) from January to March 2021. Without the humanitarian assistance delivered in Zimbabwe in 2020, these figures would be much higher, according to the IPC analysis. According to the acute food insecurity analysis update in Zambia for the February-March 2021 projection period, an estimated 1.73 million people (25% of the analysed population) are likely to face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). This includes around 1.5 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and around 240,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), who will require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods. Around 27.3 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), making the central African country the host of the highest number of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in the world. Angola has been experiencing episodes of drought since December last year with below average rainfall in the provinces of Cuanza Sul, Benguela, Huambo, Namibe and Hu\u00edla. The situation is not expected to improve in the coming months in the absence of above average rainfall. Since the beginning of March 2021, Angolans living in the border provinces of Cunene and Huila are crossing into Namibia at illegal entry points in Omusati and Ohangwena regions in search of food, water, medical services and employment opportunities. The regional councils (local authorities) have recorded altogether 894 people in Omusati and Kunene regions who have crossed into Namibia in search of food. Mozambique: In the 16 analysis units analysed in Cabo Delgado Province, in total, it is estimated that about 75,000 children aged 6-59 months are suffering and are likely to suffer from acute malnutrition in the next 12 months and, consequently, need and will need treatment. In terms of severity of the situation, for the period October 2020 to March 2021, corresponding to the season when the survey was conducted (February 2021), eight districts and two IDP centres were classified in Alert (IPC AMN Phase 2), five districts and one IDP centre were classified in Acceptable (IPC AMN Phase 1). Projection analyses of the situation indicate, that for the period April to September 2021, in districts with limited or no humanitarian access, by the end of the projection period, the situation is likely to deteriorate to Critical (IPC AMN Phase 4) in one district, to Serious (IPC AMN Phase 3) in three districts, and to Alert in four districts. Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes are widespread across much of southern Madagascar, with some households experiencing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and worst-affected households in Ambovombe and Amboasary experiencing Catastrophe ((IPC Phase 5). Minimal seasonal improvement in food access is expected in southern Madagascar due to the expected limited harvest and associated income-earning opportunities. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes with some households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) are expected to persist through at least September. Conflict continues at relatively high levels in Cabo Delgado Mozambique and parts of the DRCongo. According to OCHA, as of April, over 732,000 people were displaced in Cabo Delgado. In Kasai, DRCongo, in March, about 41,000 were displaced due to conflict. Additionally, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, recent conflict has resulted in the government\u2019s declaration of martial law. Conflict in DRC and Mozambique has disrupted agricultural and most typical livelihood activities with minimal seasonal improvements expected with the harvest. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected in these areas through at least September. As the harvest continues across most of the region, most households, including the poor, are consuming foods from their own production. Overall, households in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Lesotho, and most parts of Mozambique are anticipated to experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Minimal (IPC Phase 1) through at least September. In areas where Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes, while the harvest is expected to facilitate improved food access, household income will most likely remain below average. Millions of people in southern Angola are facing an existential threat as drought aggravated by climate change continues to ravage the region, Amnesty International said today. The organization highlighted how the creation of commercial cattle ranches on community land has driven pastoralist communities from their land since the end of the civil war in 2002 - a shift which left huge sections of the population food insecure and paved the way for a humanitarian crisis as the acute drought persists for over three years when drought struck over three years ago. As food and water grow increasingly scarce, thousands have fled their homes and sought refuge in neighbouring Namibia. The latest IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis results indicate that between July and September 2021, about 1.18 million people in Zambia are facing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Flooding, high maize prices, and pests drive the country\u2019s acute food insecurity despite a good harvest. The highly food insecure population requires urgent humanitarian assistance to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. The situation has particularly deteriorated in the Western province, where five districts were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Over 1 million people in Malawi are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase between July and September 2021. Despite Malawi\u2019s record high maize production of 46% above the five-year average, some pockets in these districts and cities experienced severe dry spells and earlier than normal tailing of rainfall. This led to localized production shortfalls coupled with the impact of COVID-19 on remittances, petty trade and self-employment activities. The population experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity require urgent action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. Around 3.6 million people are classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2), experiencing a mild level of food insecurity, while 14.1 million people are food secure-- Minimal (IPC Phase 1). All the four urban zones analyzed (Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mzuzu, Zomba) are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) while the rural areas are in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) \u2013 16 areas out of the 28 analyzed - or in IPC Phase 1 (none/minimal). The worst drought in the last 40 years and rising food prices have resulted in high acute food insecurity in the Cunene, Huila and Namibe provinces of South-Western Angola. An IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis of 17 municipalities of Southern Angola found that, between July and September 2021, around 1.32 million people (49% of the analysed population) have experienced high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), of which 38% are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 12% in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). These people face difficulties in accessing food or are only able to meet the minimum food requirements through crisis and/or emergency coping strategies. Between October 2021 and March 2022, the number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above is expected to rise to around 1.58 million people (58% of the analysed population), of which 42% are likely in IPC Phase 3 and 15% in IPC Phase 4. Three of the municipalities are also expected to move to a worse phase (Chicomba, Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes and T\u00f4mbua). Around 27 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) between September and December 2021, of which around 6.1 million people are experiencing critical levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 4). The country has the largest number of highly food insecure people in the world. This food insecurity is a result of a combination of conflict, economic decline, high food prices and the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis issued in September 2021 and covering the period from July to September 2021, about 1.18 million people in Zambia were facing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) with 77,938 people being most affected in Luapula, Lusaka and Western provinces. For the current period (November 2021 to March 2022), which coincides with the lean season, approximately 1.9 million people are estimated to be in high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) in the urban and rural areas of Mozambique that were analysed, and are in need of humanitarian assistance. Of these, 71% (1.32 million people) are in the four provinces of Cabo Delgado, Niassa, Nampula and Zamb\u00e9zia, where many of the country\u2019s Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are concentrated. One district of Tete (Changara), one of Manica (Tambara) and three of Gaza (Chibuto, Mabalane and Guij\u00e1) are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). An estimated 7.3 million people in Angola are facing food and nutrition insecurity due to climate shocks. An estimated 3.9 million children are in need of assistance. Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) admissions among children 6 to 59 months at mid-year 2021 have already exceeded the 2020 total caseload. An estimated 1.2 million people are facing water scarcity as a direct consequence of the drought and have had their water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions compromised by COVID-19. Malawi: In the current period of November 2021 to December 2021, about 1.4 million people (7% of the population) are estimated to be experiencing Crisis levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) and require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. Around 4.4 million people are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) while 13.1 million people are food secure (IPC Phase 1). Out of all rural districts, district towns and cities analysed, 26 areas are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) while six are classified in IPC Phase 1 (Minimal). No areas are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Out of the 1.4 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), around 186,000 are from urban areas (Mzuzu, Lilongwe, Zomba and Blantyre cities), representing 8% of the urban population, whilst the remaining 1.2 million people are from the rural areas and the Bomas, representing 7% of the rural and Boma population. Overall, there is concern for the 2021/22 season as rainfall through mid-December has been significantly below average across Madagascar, Malawi, central and northern Mozambique, and northwestern Zimbabwe. Across these areas, drought conditions are ongoing to start the season. Land preparation activities are delayed, and planting has yet to begin across many areas as of November. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are ongoing across rainfall deficit areas and areas of northern Mozambique and eastern DRC impacted by continued conflict. Humanitarian assistance in southern Madagascar and Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique is improving household food consumption, where Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) and Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes are ongoing, respectively. Between December 2021 and March 2022, around 336,000 people (29% of the population in Eswatini) are estimated to be facing high acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 Crisis or above) and require urgent humanitarian assistance. Of this population, 286,000 people are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 50,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). An additional 376,000 are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) and require livelihood support. Compared to the October 2021 - March 2022 projection period from the August 2021 analysis, this update shows a slight deterioration, with a slight increase in the food insecure population in IPC Phase 3 or above in all livelihood zones except for Highveld Cattle and Maize, Timber Highlands and Moist Middleveld, with the latter two having 47% of their households having food stocks lasting more than six months. This update has seen the population projected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above increase by 19,000 people. Tanzania: For the current period of analysis (November 2021 - April 2022), about 437,000 people, representing 13% of an analysed population of 3.4 million, are estimated to be experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). Overall, an estimated 22,000 people (1% of the population analysed) are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and around 415,000 people (12% of the population analysed) in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Around 785,000 people (23% of the population analysed) are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed). Amongst the 14 councils of Tanzania analysed (12 district councils [DCs] and the rural parts of two town councils [TCs]), four councils (Handeni DC, Longido, Mkinga, and Monduli) are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), with 20% to 30% of their population experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (Phase 3 or above). The rest of the councils are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed). Approximately 5.4 million people in Malawi living in rural and secondary urban centres are facing Moderate or Severe chronic food insecurity (IPC CFI Levels 3 and 4) due to abject poverty and recurrent shocks, among other drivers. The February Malawi IPC Chronic Food Insecurity (CFI) analysis found that an additional estimated 4.4 million people face Mild food insecurity, whilst approximately 6.9 million people face No/Minimal chronic food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity in Malawi, where over 70% of the population of about 19.1 million people is living below the international poverty line of $1.90/day, is driven by abject poverty, recurrent shocks, poor policies and implementation as well as reliance on weak livelihood strategies.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"The UN food agencies are escalating their responses across the nine countries, planning to assist more than 11 million people by mid-2020. In addition to addressing urgent food and nutrition needs, they will help smallholder farmers boost production and reduce losses, manage precious soil and water resources in a sustainable way and embrace climate-smart agricultural practices, better access to inputs, credit and markets, and spearhead vaccination campaigns to contain livestock disease. The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has welcomed a US$3.39 million contribution from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to help meet the immediate food needs of drought-affected people in Zambia. Through this funding, WFP will deliver 2,380 MT of pulses to complement the Government\u2019s maize for three months, giving 255,000 drought-affected people across the country the food and nutritional assistance they need.\",\n        \"affected_countries\": [\n            \"Angola\",\n            \"Botswana\",\n            \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\",\n            \"Eswatini\",\n            \"Lesotho\",\n            \"Malawi\",\n            \"Mozambique\",\n            \"Namibia\",\n            \"South Africa\",\n            \"United Republic of Tanzania\",\n            \"Zambia\",\n            \"Zimbabwe\"\n        ],\n        \"sources\": [\n            \"OCHA\",\n            \"GIEWS\",\n            \"FEWS NET\",\n            \"New Era\",\n            \"SADC\",\n            \"ECHO\",\n            \"IFAD\",\n            \"FAO\",\n            \"WFP\",\n            \"USAID\",\n            \"IPC\",\n            \"IFRC\",\n            \"Amnesty International\",\n            \"UNICEF\"\n        ],\n        \"language\": \"English\"\n    }\n}", "https://reliefweb.int/disaster/ep-2023-000223-ner": "{\n    \"https://reliefweb.int/disaster/ep-2023-000223-ner\": {\n        \"disaster_title\": \"Niger: Diphtheria Outbreak - Oct 2023\",\n        \"disaster_type\": [\"Epidemic\"],\n        \"date\": \"17 July 2023\",\n        \"disaster_description\": \"The first case of diphtheria in Niger was reported on 17 July 2023.

In addition, following previous seismic events since 7 October, at least 2,400 people have died, several hundred are reported missing, 1,714 houses have been destroyed, and 11,066 people have been affected across four districts. According to UNITAR-UNOSAT, 15 settlements have been destroyed, three severely affected and 38 moderately affected. To date, 1,384 people (759 females and 625 males) are reported to have been killed and 1,853 people injured (1,137 females and 716 males) by the earthquakes. Women and children are overly represented within reported casualties. Assessments completed to date indicate that 3,067 homes have been affected across Zindajan, Injil, Kushk / Rabat-e-Sangai, Ghulan, Herat and Khosan districts, including 2,499 which have been completely destroyed, 363 which have been severely damaged and 250 which have been moderately damaged. More than three quarters of homes destroyed are located in two districts \u2013 Zinjadin (1,353) and Injil districts (586). Additionally, 21,300 buildings are estimated to have sustained damage. On 15 October, areas north-east of Herat City were hit by a 6.3 magnitude earthquake, the third in a week to strike communities in Herat Province. Two people were reportedly killed and more than 150 people injured. Casualty numbers are not expected to rise significantly as many people are already living in the open out of fear their homes will collapse. Humanitarian facilities, residences and office spaces have sustained damage of varying severity, with engineering assessments a critical priority to differentiate between cosmetic and structural damage, and to allow traumatized residents to return to their homes. To date, 43,395 people (7,165 families) are reported to have been directly affected by the recent earthquakes across Injil (23,053 people), Kushk / Rabat-e-Sangai (8,541 people), Zindajan (7,523 people), Gulran (3,428 people), Herat (717 people) and Kohsan (133 people) districts. Injil is the worst affected district, accounting for 53 per cent of people affected. More than 3,330 homes are also reported to have been completely destroyed \u2013 the majority in Zindajan district \u2013 2,137 homes severely damaged, and 1,697 homes moderately damaged. A scale-up of response activities is underway to provide humanitarian support to communities in Herat Province, Western Afghanistan in the aftermath of a sequence of shallow, powerful earthquakes with magnitudes exceeding 6.0, accompanied by recurring aftershocks since 7 October 2023. Assessments completed to date indicate that more than 21,500 homes have been completely destroyed (8,429) \u2013 mostly in Herat, Injil and Zindajan districts \u2013 and severely damaged (17,088) in the earthquakes, affecting around 154,000 people. With temperatures already dropping ahead of the onset of winter, affected communities will also be in need of sustainable solutions to withstand harsh conditions with urgently needed assistance to restore and reconstruct homes and shelters, and reestablish livelihoods. Latest assessments show that the first two earthquakes on 7 and 11 October left 1,480 people dead and 1,950 wounded, with available satellite imagery indicating that 513 villages were impacted, and assessments ongoing. To date, nearly 43,400 people across six districts are reported to be directly affected by the recent earthquakes, with Injil and Zindajan districts worst affected. More than half of all earthquake-affected people are in Injil, with the majority of the more than 3,330 destroyed homes assessed to date located in Zindajan. Schools, health facilities, and other infrastructure also impacted by the earthquakes, with 21,300 buildings estimated to have sustained damage. Following the earthquakes, families are living in the open, in makeshift shelters, or in informal settlement sites, leaving them vulnerable to weather, health and other protection hazards. The recent series of earthquakes has left a profound impact on a substantial number of families and individuals in the affected districts. A total of 48,347 families, comprising 275,256 people, were directly affected by these seismic events. The 382 villages are situated in the districts of Herat, Injil, Kushk, Zindajan, Gulran, Guzara, Ghoryan, Karukh, and Kohsan in Herat Province. The devastation caused by these earthquakes has been substantial, with 10,002 houses completely destroyed, 20,430 houses with severe damage, and 17,588 houses with moderate damage. As a result, a significant portion of the affected population, approximately 37,139 families, are now forced to live in makeshift tents and open spaces, while 1,268 families reside in informal settlements, and another 8,801 families have resorted to tent shelters as temporary solutions. More than two months on from the first of three devastating 6.3 magnitude earthquakes in Herat Province, western Afghanistan, humanitarian actors have reached 266,800 affected people with direct assistance. Assistance provided to affected communities to date includes emergency shelter (tents) to 16,169 households, US $5.1 million in multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA) to 19,652 households\u2014almost 5,961 received the full MPCA package ($340 per household) and 4,310 the half MPCA package ($170). Additionally, 21,017 families have received non-food items, 13,101 families winter blankets and 11,782 families shelter repair kits. Emergency food assistance has also been provided to 110,033 people, livestock support to 853 people, nutritious foods to almost 64,512 boys and girls under five years old and essential primary healthcare to 60,256 people. Under protection, dignity kits have been provided to more than 11,822 women and girls, child-friendly space activities to 9,494 children and psycho-social support to 14,045 individuals, among other activities. One-third of all earthquakes affected people are in Injil, with more than 3,330 destroyed homes located in Zindajan. Approximately 37,139 families now reside in makeshift tents, open spaces, damaged shelters, 8,801 families are in tents and 1,268 families are residing in informal settlements. Notable needs for persons with specific needs, including 17,358 pregnant women, 17,146 infants, 3,976 individuals living with severe disabilities, 3,207 vulnerable elderly families, 3,139 unaccompanied children, 6,806 female headed households and 3,176 people chronically ill have been identified. These events have also resulted in extensive damage to vital water and sanitation facilities. The field data collection exercise for the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) for the Herat Earthquake was undertaken during the month. UNICEF lead the Education and WASH sectors as well as provided technical support in the Health and Nutrition sector. Preliminary results from the PDNA highlight that the most affected sectors in terms of aggregate damage and loss are housing, education, agriculture, livestock and minor irrigation, and transportation. The most affected districts include Herat, Injil, and Zindajan. Reconstruction and recovery needs for the nine assessed districts are estimated at US$ 383.9 million, with needs for one year, two to three years, and over three to five years estimated at US$ 154.5 million, US$ 190 million, and US$ 39.3 million, respectively. Although 85 days have passed since the earthquakes, many survivors and victims still live in makeshift tents and temporary shelters, with the situation remaining precarious. On December 28, a mild earthquake was reported in Herat Province. Most of the displaced individuals are grappling with various health issues, including trauma and mental health disorders. WHO and Health Cluster partners have been expanding efforts to provide healthcare assistance to the 220,000 affected individuals, including 1,900 female-headed households. By the end of December 2023, 102,655 individuals were provided with humanitarian health assistance. Despite these efforts, a significant funding gap persists. The Health Cluster has appealed for US$12.7 million to sustain these initiatives through March 2024, but only US$5.2 million has been received thus far. Following the earthquakes of 7 October 2023, the IFRC Secretariat dispatched emergency shelter and household items, allocated CHF 750,000 from the IFRC Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the ARCS immediate response. Additionally, the Emergency Appeal MDRAF007 was relaunched to incorporate immediate and recovery needs arising from the earthquakes. The latest revision of the Emergency Appeal includes a funding requirement of CHF 9 million for the Herat earthquake response.

Malnutrition rates are almost double from last year in at least one health center visited by DG ECHO in May 2022. Communities report the depletion of livestock assets, loss of body mass index, and lack of milk production followed by death of livestock. According to the latest IPC, approximately 13% of the population (132,000 people) is facing acute food insecurity (IPC3) and is in need of immediate assistance. Projections indicate an increase in food insecurity to 16% of the population by December 2022. IPC projections for July to December 2022 indicate an increase in the number of acutely food insecure people, likely reaching 192,168 people, representing 16% of analysed population (1.2 million people, which is about the entire country). The number of people in emergency (IPC 4) will likely increase 12,390 people, a 250% rise from the current numbers, while the 179,778 people could be in crisis (IPC 3). Current IPC analysis for the period of March to June 2022, highlight that approximately 132,000 people, representing 11% of the analysed population (of nearly 1.2 million people), are estimated to be acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 3 and 4). More precisely, an estimated 5,000 people (less than one percent of the population analysed) are estimated to already be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and approximately 127,000 people (11% of the population analysed) are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), about 285,000 people are estimated to face severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 [Crisis] and IPC Phase 4 [Emergency]) in the July\u2011December 2023 period. This figure, which includes about 185,000 people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 100,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), amounts to about one\u2011quarter of the country\u2019s population and it is almost 50 percent higher on a yearly basis. The high prevalence and severity of acute food insecurity and the deterioration of the food security situation are mainly due to the lingering impact of a prolonged and severe drought, which affected livelihoods between late 2020 and early 2023, and resulted in a reduction of livestock numbers by about 50 percent due to widespread deaths, severely constraining incomes and availability of livestock products for pastoralist households.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Immediate assistance is needed for approximately 13% of the population facing acute food insecurity.

The situation remains critical in parts of the South Bohemian Region, where ongoing threats of further flooding persist. As of 19 September, five fatalities were reported, along with widespread displacement of about 10,000 residents. Heavy rains brought by Storm Boris have caused severe flooding in southwestern Poland, particularly affecting the voivodeships of Dolnoslaskie, Opolskie, Slaskie, and Malopolskie. Rivers like the Morawka have overflowed, and some dams have collapsed, leading to widespread flooding. On 16 September, the Council of Ministers declared a \\\"state of natural disaster\\\" for a period of 30 days in parts of the Lower Silesian, Opole, and Silesian voivodeships.

Similarly, several townships in eastern areas of Shan State experienced flash floods and landslides between 11 and 18 August. A local community, three temporary displacement sites and a relocation site in Muse Township, which hosts around 350 displaced families have been affected. Similar incidents took place in Mogoke Township of Mandalay Region in the second week of August, with floods and landslides reportedly killing four persons, including a child, and washing away a number of houses. In Rakhine State, at least 10 villages in Toungup Township have been flooded due to heavy rains on 6 August, affecting some 1,300 houses, a hospital and paddy fields, according to local partners. Heavy rains and floods have further aggravated an already extremely challenging situation in the south-eastern parts of the country. In Kayin State, at least five townships have been affected. Another nine townships were affected by floods in Mon State, while in Tanintharyi Region, at least three townships have been affected. Local humanitarian actors, volunteers and communities responded to the needs of affected families, including with organizing temporary shelter for those who had to be evacuated to safer areas. The floods have also damaged crops, and according to initial assessments, at least 2,000 acres of paddy fields in Kyainseikgyi Township in Kayin State have been impacted, with farmers facing difficulties with seeds and expenses to cover replanting of the paddy. An additional 40,000 cultivated land has been affected across different states and regions, according to partners. The monsoon weather system is strong and active, and on 24 August, Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) forecast predicted water levels may exceed the danger level of major rivers and river dams such as Ayeyarwady River and Sittoung River that are currently in critical situation and could have the ability to impact the most at-risk areas. As of 25 August, the Thanlwin River has exceeded the danger zone. There are concerns that the weather system, fluvial floods, and flash floods could cause damage in communities across several regions, particularly in Shan (East), Kayin, Mon, Rakhine, Tanintharyi, Magway, Mandalay, Kachin, Sagaing and Chin regions. Some of these areas have experienced previous devastation by the flood in 2015 and 2017.

The deluge caused extensive damage, overwhelming local capacities and necessitating immediate humanitarian intervention. Just one day later, the communities of Duhu, Mayowandu, Kirchinga, Maiwandu, Jahili, Kokohu, Lumadu, Zhau, Pallam, Kwambula, Shuware, and Shuwa in Madagali Local Government Area were struck by another catastrophic flood, triggered by the upstream flow of waters from the Cameroonian highlands. This secondary flooding event exacerbated the already dire situation, compounding the devastation and further straining local resources. According to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), the floodwaters rose with alarming speed, catching residents off guard and resulting in the widespread destruction of homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods. The disaster has affected 12,583 individuals, displaced 2,079 households, and caused the destruction of 298 buildings, 203 farmlands, and 509 livestock. The immediate humanitarian needs include shelter, food, non-food items, medical assistance, and access to clean water. Heavy rainfall has been affecting northern Nigeria since 20 August, causing floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. According to International Rescue Committee (IRC), as of 2 September, at least 170 people died, 205,338 have been displaced, 515,794 have been affected, and 76,667 houses have been damaged across 28 out of 36 states, including Bauchi, Zamfara, Sokoto, Niger, and Jigawa states as the most impacted. Heavy rainfall continues to affect north-eastern Nigeria, causing floods and the Alau Dam overflowing, and resulting in casualties and damage. On 10 September, according to media, the overflow of the Alau Dam, approximately 15 km southwest of Maiduguri city, in Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria, flooded Maiduguri. Over 239,000 people have been affected and at least 50,000 people have been displaced across Fori, Galtimari, Gwange and Bulabulin areas. Several structures have been destroyed, including one hospital and one zoo. According to media, as of 12 September, the overflow of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River occurred on 10 September, and flooded Maiduguri city, in Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria. At least 30 people died, more than 414,000 have been displaced, approximately 1 million people have been affected, and thousands of houses and structures have been destroyed. More than 414,000 people are affected by floods in Borno State, with some 37 deaths and 58 people injured reported. Access to hospitals and markets and other critical infrastructure remains limited. Schools are closed with some serving as temporary relocation sites. Two major bridges in Maiduguri (Lagos Street Bridge and Gwange Bridge) have partially collapsed. Over 300,000 people have been registered in at least 26 relocation sites, as of 14 September, according to the Borno State Government\u2019s Emergency Operations Centre. Up to 30 sites have been set up and registration is ongoing. The flood situation across Nigeria has become a major humanitarian crisis, with 31 states and 180 local government areas (LGAs) severely affected. Over 1,083,141 individuals have been impacted by the relentless rains, leading to widespread displacement, loss of lives, and destruction of homes and livelihoods. The floods have left 641,598 persons displaced, 285 people dead, and 2,504 injured. Houses, farmlands, and critical infrastructure have been devastated, with 98,242 homes affected. Between July and September 2024, 29 states across the nation experienced exceptionally high rainfall, compounded by the collapse of the Alau Dam in the Maiduguri area of Borno State, which worsened the already dire humanitarian situation, leading to widespread flooding, the collapse of bridges, closure of schools, and restricted access to hospitals and markets. The resulting devastation has caused extensive damage to homes, infrastructure, crops, and shelters, critically disrupting livelihoods and displacing thousands of households. The latest report by UNOCHA confirms that at least one million people have been affected, with 311 lives lost and more than 3,174 injured. A total of 390,000 people have been displaced, forced to flee with only the belongings they could carry, but now finding themselves in deplorable conditions, without sufficient safeguards and exposed to heightened protection risks. Roughly 245,500 people are living in collective shelters or internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, with 2,867 communities impacted across 29 states. Over 6,490,307 square metres (649.0307 hectares) of farmland have been destroyed by the floods, foreshadowing severe humanitarian consequences. Floodwaters have receded in MMC and Jere LGAs two weeks after the 9 September collapse of the Alau Dam in Borno\u2019s Konduga LGA. As a result, and in response to ongoing efforts to reduce and consolidate temporary relocation sites, the number of people displaced by flooding has reduced from about 400,000 people housed in 36 sites at the height of the crisis to 150,000 people in 22 sites, as of 24 September. Almost four weeks after the collapse of the Alau Dam and subsequent flash floods in Borno State, flood waters have receded in the worst-hit Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) and Jere local government areas (LGAs) offering some respite to affected people. Many are returning to their homes and to host communities, while those whose homes remain submerged are being relocated to larger, more centralized temporary sites within the State. The reduction and consolidation of temporary relocation sites is ongoing to better manage the situation and to ensure the return of public facilities such as schools to their intended purpose. Several schools in Borno had been repurposed to accommodate flood-affected people. Humanitarian needs, however, remain critical despite the significant reduction in the number of displaced people living in emergency shelters, from a peak of 400,000 people at the height of flooding to about 50,000 registered individuals as of 4 October, according to the Borno State Government (BSG) Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). An additional 700,000 people also sought shelter with relatives during the flood emergency, according to authorities. Over 320 people dead, 1.3 million affected by floods in 34 states in Nigeria.

These conditions, coupled with the poor hygiene practices among citizens, has caused recurrent outbreaks of WASH related diseases.

Both Tropical Storm Rafael and the trough arrive less than three weeks after the eastern part of Cuba, particularly the province of Guant\u00e1namo, suffered the impacts of Hurricane Oscar, which resulted in eight fatalities, two people missing, and substantial material damage. The trajectory forecasts for the new storm predominantly cover the provinces of Artemisa, Pinar del R\u00edo, and the special municipality of Isla de la Juventud, but they also predict potential damage in the capital city, which would pose risks to infrastructure and housing. Significant impacts on agriculture, livelihoods, and electrical infrastructure are also anticipated amid a complex energy situation.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"48 hours after the impact of Hurricane Rafael in western and central Cuba, preliminary figures show significant damage to homes, electrical infrastructure and basic services, as well as agriculture, in a context of ongoing response to Hurricane Oscar, which affected eastern Cuba three weeks ago. So far, no human losses have been reported, and specialized brigades have been deployed from nearby provinces to support the recovery, including the restoration of basic services and cleaning up debris. The greatest damage is concentrated in the province of Artemisa, where the hurricane severely impacted its 11 municipalities. The intense damage includes the demolition of 10 electricity towers. Several communities are cut off or very difficult to access due to falling trees and power lines, as well as flooding and overflowing rivers. Approximately 800,000 people have suffered the damages caused by this powerful hurricane in the most exposed territories of Artemisa, Mayabeque, Havana and Isla de la Juventud. Following Hurricane Rafael, severe damage to the electrical system caused the water supply to be affected in the western provinces. A week after the impact, in the province of Artemisa, only 17% of the inhabitants had recovered the water supply service and in Havana, only 20%. In Mayabeque, the interruption of electricity service and water pumping continued in the municipalities of Bataban\u00f3, Quivic\u00e1n, Melena del Sur and Nueva Paz. The impact of Hurricane Rafael has so far left (damage is still quantified), some 25,471 homes with various damages, concentrating its impact in the province of Artemisa with more than 83% of the damage. Severe effects predominate considering the ravages of strong category 3 winds. As a result, some 92,000 victims have been identified. At the same time, around 60,000 people (20,000 families) have been identified with severe problems in accessing electricity; they have had coverage with small photovoltaic systems as an immediate alternative, among others to access water. At the same time, damage to the conventional power grid has affected an additional 305,000 people. With Hurricane Rafael, a total of 144 health institutions were damaged in the three affected provinces of the western region. These include 28 hospitals, 43 polyclinics, 123 family doctor's offices and 51 other types of clinics. In Artemisa, significant damage is reported in two hospitals, the Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez Pediatric Hospital in Guanajay and the Ciro Redondo Garc\u00eda General Hospital in the municipality of Artemisa.\",\n        \"affected_countries\": [\"Cuba\"],\n        \"sources\": [\"OCHA\", \"UNCT Cuba\"],\n        \"language\": \"English\"\n    }\n}", "https://reliefweb.int/disaster/ts-2004-000147-idn": "{\n    \"https://reliefweb.int/disaster/ts-2004-000147-idn\": {\n        \"disaster_title\": \"South Asia: Earthquake and Tsunami - Dec 2004\",\n        \"disaster_type\": [\"Earthquake\", \"Tsunami\"],\n        \"date\": \"26 Dec 2004\",\n        \"disaster_description\": \"On 26 Dec 2004, the fourth-largest earthquake in a century erupted underwater off the Indonesian province of Aceh, causing a tsunami that accelerated to speeds of more than 600 kilometres per hour and barreled one-fifth of the way around the earth.

This figure represents an increase of 206% compared with the same period in 2023 and 387% compared with the average for the last 5 years. On 16 February 2024, in view of the exponential increase in dengue cases observed in the first weeks of the year in several countries of the Region of the Americas, PAHO made an urgent appeal to Member States. The organization emphasized the need to intensify vector control measures and to maintain active surveillance, ensuring early diagnosis and timely treatment of cases. On 7 March 2024, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) of Guatemala, through the Directorate of Epidemiology and Risk Management, issued an epidemiological alert for dengue. This alert was established to reinforce dengue control and prevention plans, based on data accumulated up to epidemiological week 7, which ended on 17 February. As of that date, a total of 6,760 cases of dengue fever had been recorded this year, of which 31 were severe cases resulting in 3 deaths. The decision to issue this alert was motivated by the beginning of the high dengue transmission season in the country. As part of this measure, specific epidemiological surveillance actions were reinforced, including standardized protocols for the detection, notification, and registration of cases in hospitals and health areas. On 27 June, at a meeting of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the national level, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) verbally requested the National Society to replace the intervention in the department of Suchitepequez with that of Zacapa. This request was based on the significant increase of dengue cases in Zacapa and a considerable decrease in Suchitepequez. The request was made in response to evidence of the most affected areas and the shortage of personnel and resources needed by SPAS to address the national dengue emergency. Up to the 34th epidemiological week, 80,234 cases of dengue fever have been reported in the country. According to the same report, 14 of the 29 Departmental Directorates of Integrated Health Services Networks (DDRISS) reported an incidence of dengue that exceeds the national average.

The majority of schools have been unable to reopen their doors to students just as 300,000 children were set to gradually resume classes in the three quake-affected departments on 4 October. UNICEF estimates that if classrooms remain closed, following a one-month delay in school reopening in affected departments, more than 230,000 children are at risk of dropping out of school. The earthquake has triggered a spike in international migration from Haiti, compounding the existing migration crisis of Haitians in the Americas, with increasing numbers of Haitian nationals arriving on the shores of neighbouring countries.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"The Government and high-ranking UN officials negotiated humanitarian access for a relief convoy to pass through the main road linking the capital Port-au-Prince to the country\u2019s southern peninsula which, up to now, had been blocked by gangs for months, with further convoys set to deliver various supplies. On 16 August, DG ECHO mobilised \u20ac3 million in emergency humanitarian funding to address the most urgent needs of the affected population. On 16 August, the Government of Haiti sent a request for international assistance to the EU Delegation in Port-au-Prince. France, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden have already offered in-kind assistance via the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. An EU Civil Protection Team was deployed to support the national authorities and coordinate the incoming EU assistance. The mission will be supported by a Technical Assistance and Support Team from the Swedish Civil Protection (MSB). More than two weeks after the devastating 14 August earthquake, humanitarian assistance is now beginning to reach those most in need faster, facilitated by enhanced Government-led coordination and robust efforts to negotiate increased humanitarian access into hard-to reach areas. The combined impact of the earthquake and Tropical Depression Grace have left 650,000 thousand people in need of emergency humanitarian assistance, of which 500,000 are being targeted by UN agencies and humanitarian partners through the activities planned under the recently launched $187.3 million Flash Appeal. From 14 August to 1 December, over 300,185 people received emergency assistance, with 4,032 mt of food and USD 2.4 million in cash-based transfers distributed. Fuel scarcity and insecurity increased starting mid-October. A truce from mid-November saw fuel distribution slowly resume throughout the country. WFP received and responded to a significant number of fuel requests from partners prioritizing medical emergencies and life-saving activities. Road access to the areas impacted by the earthquake was restricted and truck convoys from Port-au-Prince to the south were suspended as of mid-October. WFP continued its barge service from Port-au-Prince to the commune of Carrefour in the suburban area of the capital to transport humanitarian assistance to the south. Since the earthquake, over 130 voyages have been organised. Despite these delays and challenges, distributions by WFP and partners continued. Access to basic healthcare, nutrition, and safe water, sanitation, and hygiene services remains critical with important needs after the devastating earthquake that hit southwestern Haiti on 14 August. According to the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), total damages and loss are estimated at US$ 1.62 billion, while recovery needs at US$ 1.98 billion. Relief efforts have been severely hampered by a shortage of fuel throughout the country, while the humanitarian corridor has been interrupted due to increased gangs\u2019 violence and insecurity. UNICEF water trucking facilitated access to water for drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene for approximately 419,000 persons (69,000 in the reporting period). The construction of 75 blocks of latrines for the sites hosting the displaced people is ongoing, in respect of accessibility standards for people with disabilities.\",\n        \"affected_countries\": [\"Haiti\"],\n        \"sources\": [\"IFRC\", \"OCHA\", \"DG ECHO\", \"UNICEF\", \"WFP\"],\n        \"language\": \"English\"\n    }\n}", "https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2006-000092-kor": "{\n    \"https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2006-000092-kor\": {\n        \"disaster_title\": \"Rep. of Korea: Floods - Jul 2006\",\n        \"disaster_type\": [\"Flood\"],\n        \"date\": \"2006-07-24\",\n        \"disaster_description\": \"Torrential rains commenced on 14 July in the Republic of Korea and particularly affected Gangwon, Kyonngi provinces and Seoul.

As water levels rise in rivers, there are reports of riverine flooding in Jubaland. FAO\u2019s Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) reported heavy rains in Somaliland where on 26 April, Lughaye and surrounding areas received unusually heavy rains of 102mm. On 23 April, heavy rains were also received within the Juba river basin. SWALIM forecasts increased rainfall activity in most areas in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands in the coming week, which is likely to keep the water levels high in the Shabelle and Juba rivers. The flooding has started barely four months after heavy Deyr (October-December) rains inundated parts of Somalia, affecting over half a million people; and as the country works to contain the COVID-19 virus, which is exponentially rising and has already infected several hundreds of people. The country is also working to contain a desert locust infestation. Since 20 April, heavy rain has been affecting most of Somalia States and territories (particularly South West, Jubaland, Banadir, Puntland, and Somaliland) as well as the neighbouring central and south Ethiopia since 24 April, causing rivers to overflow and triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The worst affected area is the Juba river basin and the Shabelle river basin. In Somalia, as of 29 April, media report 10 fatalities, a number of missing people, around 20 injured people, hundreds more displaced, as well as damage to infrastructure in Qardho Town (Bari Region, west Puntland). The number of people affected by flooding in Somalia has risen to 546,103, of whom 216,895 people have been displaced from their homes and 16 others killed since the Gu\u2019 rains started in early April. At least 27 districts are inundated; the worst being Belet Weyne in Hiran region where riverine flooding has displaced more than 115,000 people, according to the district flood taskforce. This includes about 91,000 people who have been displaced from the four sections of the town and 23,220 people from 23 riverine villages. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy rains in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands. According to the taskforce, more people were fleeing their homes as river levels rise. As of 10 May, the river levels reached 7.93 meters which is 0.37 meter below the bank full level of 8.30 meters. Ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 918,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts, as of 16 May. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to crowding in areas where displaced people are seeking temporary shelter. As of 19 May, ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 919,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts. Belet Weyne in Hiraan region is the most affected district after the Shabelle river burst its banks on 12 May, inundating 85 per cent of Belet Weyne town and 25 riverine villages. According to the district flood taskforce, about 240,000 people were displaced from the town and neighbouring villages between 12 and 18 May. In Jowhar district, Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected more than 98,000 people in 37 locations, bringing the total affected in Hirshabelle to 338,000 people. According to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in Hirshabelle State, nearly 40 per cent of those affected in Jowhar have been displaced from their homes. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to overcrowding in areas where the displaced people are seeking temporary. Flash and riverine floods have since late June affected an estimated 191,800 people in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region. Among those affected, about 124,200 people have been displaced from their homes. Another 5,000 people are at risk of further displacement in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle. Since May, an estimated 149,000 hectares of farmland have been damaged by floods in 100 villages in Jowhar, Mahaday and Balcad districts, Middle Shabelle region. The latest floods point to a worrying pattern where extreme weather conditions are increasing in frequency and intensity. Prior to June 2020, flash floods and riverine flooding caused by seasonal rains displaced more than 450,000 in the country. With floods in 2018 and 2019 displacing 281,000 and 416,000 persons respectively, the flood-based displacement figures demonstrate a rising year-to-year trend. Somalia\u2019s re-occurring climate related emergencies result in devastating impact on communities who heavily rely on farming and livestock for their livelihood. Riverine flooding continues to displace people and inundate farmland in rural areas mainly along the Shabelle river valley. The floods, which are attributed to the Hagaa seasonal rains, have affected nearly 500,000 people since late June in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland States, as well as Banadir region.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"OCHA and other humanitarian organizations have been actively involved in providing relief to the affected populations.

A tsunami warning was issued but has since been lifted. Search and rescue operations are ongoing at the time of reporting. Preliminary reports indicate observed damages to buildings and infrastructure in Port Vila, with six unconfirmed casualties and injuries reported. According to UNOSAT initial exposure analysis, an estimate of 116,000 people could be affected by the worst impacts of the earthquake. Telecommunications remain disrupted and is affecting the timeliness of field reports from remote areas. Access to the airport and water port is severely limited due to road damage. Key immediate needs include healthcare support, shelter, access to clean water, and the restoration of emergency communications. As of 18th December, NDMO confirmed 14 fatalities either from collapsed buildings or landslides. The numbers may rise as search and rescue operations intensifies and expands. Over 200 are reported injured while many are still missing. According to UNICEF staff on the ground, most injuries are fractures, cuts and traumas related to falling objects and sharp items. According to NDMO, two major water reservoirs in Port Vila are severely damaged. Assessment of water network is ongoing with affected residents already rationing water. Approximately 80,000 people have been directly affected by the earthquake, of which 14,104 are children and 769 are persons with disabilities (PWD). The Disaster Evacuation Centre Management Cluster (DEMC) reports that 947 people have been displaced. Infrastructure damage is extensive, with landslides further obstructing road access in Efate and outer islands, including routes to the Seaport. The airport is currently closed to all commercial flights. Physical Access challenges continue to hamper response efforts. The situation in Vanuatu remains critical following the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck on December 17, 2024. VMGD has confirmed that approximately 300 aftershocks, ranging from magnitudes of 2.0 to 5.3, have occurred with shallow depths between December 17 and December 19. The earthquake has resulted in significant devastation, with the death toll rising to 14 (eight males, five females, one unknown) and 265 injuries. Two major water reservoirs in Port Vila sustained severe damage, and ongoing assessments of the water network have led to water rationing for residents. Port Vila International Airport resumed commercial flights on 22 December, following consultations with airport agencies. However, landslides and damaged roads and bridges have hindered access to the airport and seaport. While the airport is operational, the seaport is still closed. The situation is compounded by the ongoing cyclone season, with three tropical cyclones predicted in the region posing more risks to already vulnerable populations. State of Emergency (SOE) concluded on December 24, 2024 with the coordination of operations transitioning to the Recovery Operations Centre (ROC) under the Prime Minister's Office. The NDMO, National Cluster Partners and Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) members are coordinating ongoing distribution of relief items to meet needs identified under the SOE including shelter, WASH, Protection, Health, Food and other essential supplies. Power, Water and phone service has been largely restored though internet services are still under repair. The situation in Vanuatu remains critical following the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck on December 17, 2024. Ongoing aftershocks pose a high risk of landslides and building collapses. The earthquake has resulted in at least 14 fatalities and more than 265 injuries. 1,092 people remain temporarily displaced, 570 houses have been damaged affecting 2,850 people. Infrastructure damage is extensive, with landslides obstructing road access to Efate and the outer islands, including the main seaport. In the education sector, 110 classrooms across 45 schools have been partially or completely damaged. Now that the State of Emergency has ended, the government has established a Recovery Operation Centre (ROC). In early January, the Director of the Department of Strategic Policy, Planning, and Aid Coordination (DSPPAC) and the Chairman of the ROC estimated that around CHF 217 million (VUV 29 billion) was needed to fund the recovery. As of 21 January, VRCS has reached an estimated total of 9,072 people with the support of its partners, including the IFRC. As of 17 January 2025, the Vanuatu Displacement and Evacuation Centre Management (DECM) cluster reported 315 people remained formally displaced. Of these, 39 were staying in two evacuation centres, while the remaining 364 were staying with 25 host households. It is likely that there are others who are displaced and staying with family and friends. On 7 January 2025, the Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) reported that 570 houses had been identified as damaged. The PHT also reported that the 13 health facilities in affected areas were functional, although some required minor repairs.

Government officials raised the Volcanic Alert Level from 2 to 3 on 18 March 2018. Ambae volcano is a very large volcano and is frequently active. Eruptions have been recorded every 10 to 50 years over the past 150 years. The current eruption is focused in the summit crater. As of 16 April, the volcano once again spewed out ash and harmful smoke. Vanuatu's government is now looking into acquiring land to permanently resettle the island's 13,000 residents. The Council of Ministers has declared a State of Emergency on Ambae Island. Approximately 750 people have lost their homes, 643 as a result of the volcanic ash, and 115 by landslides. The Council of Ministers has ordered the entire population to evacuate the island. As of 27 April, there has been resistance to the mandatory evacuation plan over a 2-week period between 1 to 15 May. The Penama provincial government declared that they will purchase land on the West and East of Ambae to accommodate people who need to evacuate from the worst affected areas. The proportion of the population who will require on-/off-island assistance remains unclear, and it is anticipated that evacuated populations will require emergency shelter assistance and household items. As of 15 May, the volcanic activity has decreased with reduced ashfall experienced during the first two weeks of May. The ash has, however, increased the risk of landslides, two of which were triggered by heavy rain and destroyed all houses in two communities. Residents in the most ash-affected communities have been evacuated to designated safe zones. Some 112 families (469 persons) from southern Ambae have sought refuge in 10 host communities in the east, whilst 757 families (3,055 persons) from the northern communities are temporarily sheltering in Saint Patrick\u2019s College and Torgil Training Center in the northeast. An undetermined number have voluntarily relocated to Santo, Efate and other nearby islands. A state of emergency was in effect on the island of Ambae until 13 July as the activity of the Manaro Voui volcano remained unpredictable. On 7 June, the threat level of the Manaro Voui volcano is categorized as \u201cmajor unrest state\u201d, and was lowered from volcanic alert level three to level two; with the danger zone now limited to a 2 km radius from the active vent. Parts of Ambae Island have been blanketed with ash for weeks, and although volcanic activity has recently decreased, light ashfall continues to be experienced in some northern parts of the island. In previous weeks, the ashfall had increased the risk of landslides, two of which were triggered by heavy rain and destroyed all houses in two affected communities. Residents in the most ash-affected communities left their homes and evacuated to designated safe zones. Some 2,000 residents remain displaced on Ambae living with host communities or in evacuation centres on the island, whilst around 800 people are known to have voluntarily left Ambae relocating to Santo, Efate and other nearby islands. As of 10 July, the Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 2 due to its continued and major unrest state. Observations have confirmed that the volcanic activity has been unstable since 20 June. On 1 July, the volcano emitted a column of ash which induced heavy to light ash fall driven by the prevailing trade wind at villages from North-West to West of Ambae Island and the North-Eastern part of Santo Island. A small eruption scale in Lake Voui is continuing. On 16 July, much of the east and north of Vanuatu's Ambae Island experienced heavy ashfall after the eruption from the volcano intensified, residents said. A second state of emergency was declared by the Government of Vanuatu\u2019s Council of Ministers (COM) from 26 July to 26 September 2018. In addition, an order was made to immediately evacuate all people in Ambae to nearby Maewo island. As of 23 August, Ambae volcano remains in the minor eruption state at Volcanic Alert Level 3. The volcanic activity is likely to remain at the minor eruptive activity or decrease to a major level of unrest at any time. The Danger Zone for life safety is limited at 3 km radius from the active vent and areas located in the Yellow Zone. As of 21 September, Ambae volcano is in the major unrest state. The Volcanic Alert Level is lowered to Level 2. The Danger Zone for life safety is now limited at 2 km radius from the active vent and areas located in the Yellow Zone. Observations in September 2018 confirm that the eruptive activity occurred in July until August has dropped. There is no explosions and volcanic cloud emitted are white colour, means only steam.

Koshi, Karnali, and Narayani are the major river systems in Nepal, and floods from these large perennial river systems generally impact several districts in the Southern Terai plains. Moreover, rivers such as West Rapti, and Babai Rivers, which originate in the Mahabharat range, do more damage in the Terai floodplains because they frequently generate flash floods during the monsoon. Moreover, the Terai's vulnerable topography, combined with its dependency on agriculture, exacerbates the severity of flood hazards compared to other regions. The targeted flood-prone areas are the Terai districts along the flood plains of Karnali, Babai and West Rapti rivers, namely Banke, Bardiya and Kailali, frequently affected due to flooding in the monsoon period. People living along these rivers especially low-lying areas, informal settlements, fragile houses, and those who have low-income status and a number of dependent family members to care for, are highly vulnerable to flooding; especially during the monsoon (June to September). The monsoon season is impacting several parts of Nepal, causing floods, triggering landslides and resulting in casualties and damage. According to the Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal, as of 8 July, 21 people have died since the beginning of the month - 12 due to landslides and nine others to floods - three people are still missing, 29 have been injured and 541 families have been affected across several districts of the country. Heavy rainfall has been affecting central Nepal (particularly the Gandaki province and the neighbouring Bagmati province over the last 24 hours, triggering huge landslides that have resulted in casualties and damage. Media report, as of 12 July, 11 fatalities across the Kaski district (Gandaki province), one fatality and 65 persons still missing in the Chitwan district (Bagmati province) due to different landslide events. Over the next 96 hours, very heavy rainfall is still forecast over most of Nepal. In the past few days, a series of landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rainfall have occurred in parts of Nepal and resulted in casualties and damage. In particular, in Chitwan District, south-central Nepal, a major landslide swept away two passenger buses, leading to eight fatalities and 54 still missing people as reported by the Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal (DRR) and media. According to the DRR portal, since 10 July, a total of 25 people died and 13 others have been injured in five different landslide events across the districts of Baglung, Chitawan, Kaski, and Myagdi. With the onset of monsoon rainfall in various parts of Nepal, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs, 143 people died and 47 people went missing as of data dated 30th July 2024 due to disasters such as floods and landslides in various places. 22 people died in Koshi province, 6 people died in Madhesh province, 31 people died in Bagmati province due to floods and landslides. According to the ministry, 42 people died in Gandaki province, 24 people in Lumbini, 8 people in Karnali and 10 people in Sudurpaschim province. During the period, more than 3,779 households were displaced from their homes by the disaster. A glacial lake outburst occurred in the Koshi province (the easternmost province of Nepal) on 16 August, causing flash floods and mudslides that resulted in displacement and damage.

AMPHAN is expected to continue towards the Odisha coast, slightly weakening before making landfall over southern West Bengal on the morning of 20 May with maximum sustained winds of 190-210 km/h. The Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) in Bangladesh estimates that up to 14.2 million people in coastal districts are likely to be affected, with nearly 1.4 million displaced and up to 600,000 houses damaged. Evacuation from high-risk areas is to begin today and is already underway in high-risk areas in India. Tropical Cyclone AMPHAN continues towards India's Odisha and West Benagal States and southern Bangladesh's Barisal Division. On 20 May at 0.00 UTC its centre was 195 km south-east of Bhubaneshwar City (Odisha), and 370 km south-southwest of Kolkata (West Bengal), with maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h. According to media reports, national authorities in India are evacuating 1.1 to 1.2 million people from Odisha and from West Bengal, 2 million in Bangladesh. AMPHAN should make landfall over southern West Bangal (approximately 50 km south of Haldia and 100 km south of Kolkata) on 20 May, with maximum sustained winds up to 160 km/h before weakening as it moves over eastern West Bengal and western and central Bangladesh on 20-21 May.

According to the latest special weather bulletin of the Met Department of Bangladesh issued around 7.30 p.m., the cyclone currently lies over the coastal West Bengal and Sundarban on the Bangladeshi coast after making a landfall around 4 p.m. in West Bengal. It is likely to move in a north-northeasterly direction further and complete crossing the coast within the next 3-4 hours. Maximum wind speed within 74 kilometres of the Cyclone centre is about 160 kilometre per hour (kmph) rising to 180 kmph in gusts/ squalls. TC AMPHAN made landfall between Digha (West Bengal) and Hatiya Islands (Bangladesh) on Wednesday 20 May as category 3 storm (Saffir-Simpson scale) bringing strong winds up to 185 km/h and heavy rain, damaging houses, crops and cutting power supplies to cities and towns already struggling to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. At least 14 people have been reported killed in India and 7 in Bangladesh. More than three million people have been evacuated to emergency shelters. After landfall TC AMPHAN was downgraded to a tropical depression, but is expected to bring heavy to moderate rain over the next 24 hours in the northeast Indian states, West Bengal and Sikkim, as well as in most of Bangladesh, including in the Rohingya refugees camps. According to UNICEF's reporting, the storm has put many people at risk, not only as a direct effect of floods and wind damage, but also given the potential spread of COVID-19 in crowded evacuation shelters. At least 77 deaths in India and 25 in Bangladesh have been reported so far. Over three million people in both countries continue to remain in community shelters. Significant damage has been reported in thatched houses, standing crops, horticulture, fisheries, power and telecommunication facilities in cyclone-affected areas. Most areas remained without electricity and communication network and blocked roads limiting a rapid response. In Cox's Bazar, flooding and small landslides have caused damage to 300 shelters, blocked drains and damaged stairs, latrines and bridges. In India, Odisha and West Bengal states were affected, with nearly 60 million people affected and at least 80 people killed in West Bengal alone. More than 700,000 people were evacuated across India and at least 80,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. In Bangladesh, 10 million people were affected by Cyclone Amphan and at least 25 people were killed. An estimated 2.4 million people were evacuated ahead of the storm. According to preliminary reports, 330,000 houses were damaged, including 55,600 destroyed in the nine most affected districts. The cyclone led to the internal displacement of at least 100,000 people who are currently staying on embankments and with friends or relatives. Satkhira, Khulna, Barguna, and Patuakhali districts were most severely affected, with up to 1.2 million people highly affected in those four districts alone. In Bangladesh, tropical cyclone Amphan has severely affected the livelihoods of at least 1 million people, destroyed houses and infrastructure, including irrigation facilities. According to initial Government estimates, the overall damage to housing, infrastructure, fisheries, livestock and crops was set at BDT 11 billion (USD 130 million). The most affected areas are located in the southwestern parts of the country, including the districts of Khulna, Jessore, Satkhira, Bagerha and Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhota and Noakhali. Although the path of the cyclone did not hit Cox\u2019s Bazar, the effects of the cyclone nevertheless was felt in the refugee settlements in Cox\u2019s Bazar, which received heavy rain and strong winds. The Bangladesh Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) raised three flags as an alert sign for refugees in the Cox\u2019s Bazar refugee settlements. The three flag was the highest alert level that refugees have seen for a cyclone since many of them first arrived in Bangladesh in 2017. Over 1,252 shelters were partially damaged and 159 shelters completely destroyed, temporarily displacing 144 households. In total, close to 6,000 refugees were affected by the cyclone. According to the rapid assessment report conducted in June 2020 by Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), in West Bengal, India, 2.9 million houses were reported damaged. There was a need for supply of shelter kits, utensils, tarpaulins, lighting solutions for those who had fully or partially lost their houses. Heath facilities damaged in West Bengal by the cyclone included 563 primary health centres, 169 Block primary health centres and 5,142 sub-centres at the community level. The existing health systems were already overwhelmed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the damages due to the cyclone made this worse. The waterlogged areas with debris and other waste materials would accelerate the risk of water and vector-borne diseases. According to Need Assessment Working Group (NAWG) report dated 31 May, approximately 2.6 million people were affected, 205,368 houses were damaged, 55,767 houses were destroyed in the 19 affected districts in Bangladesh. Total 26 people lost their lives. In addition, 40,894 latrines; 18,235 water points; 32,037 hectares of crops and vegetable; 18,707 hector of fish cultivation area; 440 km of road and 76 km of embankment were damaged. Later in August, due to active monsoon conditions and lack of sustainable repair of embarkment, a strong tidal surge has given rise to the water levels of the Shibsa, Kapotakkho and Koyra in Khulna, rivers causing breaches in the protection embankments in the already disaster-stricken coastal district bordering the Bay of Bengal. Twelve villages in Koyra and Paikgachha upazila, which were already severely damaged by cyclone Amphan and tidal water, have once again been flooded by this tidal surge. Six months after the cyclone, villages in Satkhira, Khulna remain inundated as Water Development Board (WBD) yet to repair damaged embankments. As a result of broken embarkment, around 50,000 people have been severely affected in Koyra and Paikgachha upazilas under Khulna district. At least 15,000 people exposed to serious waterlogging issues. In Satkhira district, 375 acres of land inundated as Kholpetua River breaches embankment and flooding 250 acres of farmlands and fish enclosures in this low-lying villages due to Kopotakkho river embankment collapsed and waterlogged hundreds of families.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"The Indian Meteorological Department issued an orange alert for the region, and a red alert for Gangetic West Bengal.

The current season is the second driest in 40 years. Iraq is anticipating a serious drought this summer following a particularly dry winter and reduced river flow caused by upstream damming programs by riparian countries. Climate change has potential impacts on food security such as reduction in wheat production, decrease in surface water storage, drying of shallower wells due to insufficient groundwater recharge, and an increase in the cost of water. If the dry conditions continue, and the water reservoirs are not replenished, the population will face an acute water shortage for irrigation of the next cropping season. In Iraq, large swathes of farmland, fisheries, power production and drinking water sources have been depleted of water. In the Ninewa governorate, wheat production is expected to go down by 70 per cent because of the drought, while in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq production is expected to decrease by half. Some families in Anbar who have no access to river water are spending up to USD80 a month on water. Temperatures are hitting record highs; last year saw Baghdad\u2019s highest temperature ever of 52 degrees Celsius. WFP\u2019s assessments revealed that the 2021 rainfall season has been below average, particularly in the northern governorates and Kurdistan Region. This could impact the final yield of the two major crops; wheat and barley. WFP\u2019s May surveys noted that 8 percent of people in Ninewa and Kirkuk governorates have insufficient food consumption, twice as many as the 4 percent national average. Similarly, 13.4 percent of people in Ninewa reported employing negative coping strategies \u2013 such as borrowing money or eating less food \u2013 above the 7.5 percent national average. As consistently reported by UN Iraq, drought and water scarcity are pressing concerns, and the marshlands of southern Iraq are among the worst affected areas. With annual evaporation varying from 2.5 to 3 meters, and starkly reduced riverine flows supplying the marshlands, the area covered by water has been substantially reduced.

An estimated population of 6 million are expected to be food insecure in Zimbabwe during 2024-2025 lean season. The current El Ni\u00f1o induced drought is expected to impact the food and nutrition security situation, reducing food access and diversity, and thereby the overall quality of people\u2019s diets.

Although the start of the 2024/25 rainy season in late 2024 is forecast to be average and will likely support engagement in agricultural activity, humanitarian assistance needs will remain high in many areas of the country until the harvest in 2025 due to poor purchasing capacity as a result of limited income-earning opportunities and high food prices. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected throughout the country from October 2024 through May 2025.

The earthquake was centered at latitude 16.4 South and longitude 168.2 East. The island, which has a population of about 12,000 and is about 63 km long and 12 km wide, was the worst hit area. The earthquake was followed within fifteen minutes by a tsunami that swept ashore at Marteli Bay on the southern tip of the island. The tidal wave reportedly reached about 2 kilometres into the bush. The earthquake was felt in Port Vila, 450 km to the south. Minor damage has also occurred on the islands of Ambrym, Malekula and Epi. The effects of the earthquake across Pentecost appear to be relatively localised. Eight fatalities have been reported; five persons died when their house collapsed in the central village of Ena; three others died after being swept out to sea by the tsunami. A further two are missing. About 40 serious injuries were also reported, particularly at Ena village, Melsisi Mission, Ranwadi High School, and the nearby areas. The tsunami at Marteli Bay has flattened all low-lying structures including the brick schoolhouse, leaving only the church still standing. It destroyed the piped water supply, caused loss of all public and private possessions in the community including 7 boats and 4 generators, and covered gardens in silt. Pentecost's already pre-existing access problems are now significantly worsened due to landslides. Several slopes are clearly unstable, posing a threat in the next heavy rainfall to people directly in their path, and cutting access to essential services for many more. Water supply has also been affected, as wells have caved in, water catchments affected, and some water tanks were toppled, though these should be capable of repair. Aftershocks to the 27 November earthquake have continued to affect Penama Province in the northeast of Vanuatu. Significant landslides have occurred not only on Pentecost, but also on Ambrym, Paama and Epi Islands, where damage to houses, roads, and water supply systems, has been reported. The confirmed death toll is ten. Five were killed at Ena Village in the earthquake, and five in the tsunami at Martelli Bay at Southern Pentecost. The major secondary threat is that posed by the volcano on Ambrym Island (population: 9,000). During the earthquake its two cones, Marum and Benbow, ejected their crater lakes down dry gullies. New fissures have developed on the flanks of the mountainous peninsula to the north, and the volcano now displays signs of heightened activity. Villagers are reportedly on the move, but no details are yet available. On Pentecost Island, villagers are currently relocating 6km inland from Bay Martelli (population 270), to mitigate the threat of future tsunami, and from St. Henrie (population 2-300) on the southeast coast, because of the risk of landslide. Inhabitants of other villages in the centre, south and east, remain afraid of landslides precipitated by further tremors, and have not yet resumed gardening. On Ambrym Island the village of Konkon in the northeast (population 120) has evacuated and will relocate due to the threat of mudslides from the peak above. An aftershock on 13 December 1999 caused land-slips which damaged food gardens belonging to the villages of Fancever, Linpul, Ranon, Ranvetlam,and Vanlap. On Paama Island, the main concern is that ground-shaking will have damaged root-crops, reducing the yield of these crops for up to 6 months. Although the earthquake caused a large uplift (80cm) of Southeastern Ambrym and land subsidence and the appearance of substantial cracks in the north, scientific investigation has revealed these cracks to be land-slips, and that continuing tremors are seismic rather than volcanic. The risk of volcanic eruption is reported to be no greater than normal. However, the land uplift has exposed the reef platform to the air, causing it to dry out and die, and it has lowered the water table, which may lead to water shortages in future. Assistance has been provided to many communities on Pentecost, notably Bay Barrie, Bay Martelli, Enkul, Enna, Levetlis and Tsintete, Melsisi, Narua, Point Cross, Ranwas, St. Henrie and Tanbok. Some food has been supplied to Paama Island, and food and bags of assorted clothing have gone to communities in North and Southeast Ambrym. Further substantial relief is unlikely to be provided, as the focus is shifting to recovery. The relief coordination and distribution base established at Lonoror airstrip in East Pentecost, was scaled back from 16 police personnel and 12 provincial/local government staff on 15 December. One month after the earthquake that struck Pentecost, Ambrym and Paama Islands, widespread landslides have affected Paama, a small 9 km by 4 km island with a population of 1,606. The earthquake of 27 November 1999 had caused large land-slips and wide cracks in hillsides across the island. These generated further slips after heavy rain on the night of 26 December. No one is reported missing or injured. Whilst the earthquake destroyed 92 houses and affected almost all households on Paama, damage from the recent landslides is reported to be concentrated in the northern half of the island. Mudflows 2-4m deep have damaged houses, schools and small shops, and buried food gardens, water catchment systems, wells and other water sources. Nearly all roads linking the villages are blocked in places, and though access on foot has been re-established, many paths are unsafe due to the risk of further slides. There is only one telephone line still in service for the entire island. In Liro village the kindergarten was destroyed, two teachers' houses, the island's junior secondary school and health centre were all damaged, including having their wells buried in mud. The school requires urgent attention before the beginning of term. In Luli and Lulep the water supply system is destroyed. The mudflows have blocked existing water-courses, causing water to pool and providing breeding areas for mosquitoes carrying malaria and dengue fever. Other water-borne disease outbreaks remain a possibility whilst access to potable water sources is restricted. More landslides during heavy rainfall are anticipated, with further effects on housing, agricultural production and access. The site of the telecommunications repeater station is very vulnerable, and the next rain could wash the whole system into the valley below.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Assistance has been provided to many communities on Pentecost, notably Bay Barrie, Bay Martelli, Enkul, Enna, Levetlis and Tsintete, Melsisi, Narua, Point Cross, Ranwas, St. Henrie and Tanbok.

Initial reports indicate that 26 people were reportedly killed, four people injured, and hundreds of houses were damaged or destroyed. Heavy rains in the area prior to the earthquake reportedly rendered mud brick houses more vulnerable to damage. The preliminary estimate by the inter-agency team is that up to 1,000 houses were damaged or destroyed by the earthquake. According to the information received from the local sources, the number of deaths due to the earthquake have risen to 27 people. People in affected areas are using water wells that are unsafe. In Badrawak village, there are concerns for the potential of landslides on hills on both sides of the community with a population of 2,520 people (360 families). On 20 January, another earthquake struck in the areas, leading to the death of one person. Residents in the area remain very concerned about further earthquakes. Many are too afraid of going into their homes and are currently living under the makeshifts/traditional tents in cold weather conditions. As of 20 January, the joint assessment team has assessed 742 families and identified 434 families requiring humanitarian aid, while further assessments are ongoing within the affected areas. Due to the winter season, the areas affected had experienced rain for two days before the initial earthquake, with temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius, compromising the structural integrity of the building structures, which are mostly made from mud. Those who have either lost their houses or have had their houses damaged by the earthquake face an extreme environment. At the same time, they are also coping with a lack of access to food, winter supplies, and an economic downturn. The anticipated needs of the affected population, which are currently being assessed and confirmed are food, clean water, shelter, sanitation facilities, hygiene items and household items. As of 22 January, based on the latest update, 1,254 households were assessed by the joint assessment team, out of which 834 households were identified for assistance.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"As of 20 January, the joint assessment team has assessed 742 families and identified 434 families requiring humanitarian aid, while further assessments are ongoing within the affected areas.

As of 2 December 2024, the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) reported that approximately 137,410 people have been affected by the ongoing floods across multiple areas in Malaysia. The Deputy Prime Minister, informed the media that this year's flooding is the worst since 2014, with Kelantan and Terengganu being particularly badly affected.

The disaster has claimed five lives in Kelantan and Terengganu, as confirmed by the Department of Social Welfare (JKM). The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security reported that Malaysia has suffered approximately about CHF 1.79 million in losses due to the destruction of rice/paddy plantation caused by the flood. The significant damage has forced the country to increase reliance on imported rice to meet domestic needs. Overall, the Malaysian agriculture sector faces a total estimated loss of CHF 3.77 million due to the disaster.

These conditions are expected to exacerbate the ongoing flooding, increasing the number of affected individuals and intensifying challenges for emergency response and recovery efforts. Persistent heavy rainfall has already caused river water levels to surpass designated danger thresholds, posing a severe risk of river overflows that could inundate surrounding areas. This relentless rainfall has caused extensive damage, not only to homes but also to critical infrastructure. Roads, airports, and railways, particularly in the East Coast states, have been severely affected, cutting off intercity connections and complicating relief efforts.

The eastern coastal states of Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and Johor have been the hardest hit, with heavy rainfall leading to widespread flooding, displacement, and significant disruptions to daily life. METMalaysia forecasts an additional five to seven episodes of heavy rainfall during this monsoon season, signalling that the situation may continue for several months. The floods have caused substantial damage to homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods, with roads, airports, and railways particularly affected in the East Coast states. This has disrupted intercity connectivity and hampered relief efforts. Landslides have compounded the crisis, underscoring the need for stronger disaster mitigation and response strategies.

In addition, about 14,000 people were displaced by floods and landslides in the northern part of the country. On 25 March, the President of Malawi declared a national disaster. The National Response Plan launched in April estimates the needs at US$449 million. Similarly, neighbouring countries of Zambia and Zimbabwe have also declared national drought emergencies. Approximately 4.2 million people (20 percent of the analysed population) are expected to experience high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) in Malawi in the current period (June and September 2024), including 56,000 people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and 4.1 million people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). These populations require urgent humanitarian action to reduce their food consumption gaps, protect and restore their livelihoods and prevent high levels of acute malnutrition. An additional 6.7 million people are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) between the same period and require interventions to mitigate disaster risks and safeguard their livelihoods. Most of the population in Phase 3 or above are not able to produce enough of their own food and are dependent on market purchases for their food needs. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate during the projection period from October 2024 to March 2025 which coincides with the lean season in Malawi. The resulting impact of El Ni\u00f1o on crop production will exacerbate the situation further and is likely to result in an earlier onset of the lean season.

On 17 July 2018, Tropical Storm Son-tinh (locally known as Henry) made landfall in Cagayan (northeast Philippines). Although the storm exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) the same day, it enhanced the habagat (local name for the annual southwest monsoon) which has been affecting the country since early July. On 19 July, Severe Tropical Storm Ampil (locally known as Inday) made landfall on the eastern side of the country, causing more rain over the western part of the Philippines as it further enhanced the habagat. Ampil exited PAR on 20 July. Tropical depression Josie, which formed inside PAR on 21 July exacerbated the situation further, bringing more rain to the already saturated countryside and cities. The habagat usually starts in June or July in the Philippines and generally lasts until early September. To date, the impacts of this monsoon season have been enhanced by the three weather disturbances, bringing scattered and widespread heavy rain and flooding over the Cordillera Administrative Region, National Capital Region, CALABARZON, Western Visayas, Ilocos Region, Cagayan Valley and Northern Palawan. Residents of these regions, particularly those living near rivers, in low-lying areas or mountainous areas, have been advised by the Philippine government to take actions against flooding and landslides. Evacuations have been ordered in some areas. As of 25 July, the Department of Social Welfare and Development reports that a total of 288,860 families (1,279,943 people) in 1,136 barangays (communities) in 21 provinces have been affected by the combined effects of the habagat and the weather disturbances. Of these affected people, 12,127 families (48,830 people) remain at 293 evacuation centres (ECs) while a further 120,286 households (484,721 people) were served or are being supported by the government outside ECs while staying with host families or friends. At its peak, there were more than 500 ECs accommodating 87,000 people. NDRRMC also reported 79 incidents of landslides, collapsed structures and maritime incidents, as well as 379 areas that remain flooded as of reporting. At the height of the rainfall, more than 700 areas were flooded across 6 regions. Furthermore, more than 1.377 billion Philippine pesos (72.6 million Swiss francs) worth of damage to infrastructure and agriculture has been reported as of 26 July \u2013 65 per cent being in agricultural losses. The national weather bureau PAGASA has forecasted more rain in the coming days as the habagat continues to affect the country. The Philippine government continues to send rainfall warnings and flood advisories through SMS and other media platforms to at-risk communities. Monsoon rains, enhanced by Tropical Storm Yagi (local name Karding), have flooded Metro Manila and other parts of the country. As of 14 August, 173,000 people have been displaced in the national capital and regions I, III, IV-A, and CAR. Approximately 102,300 people are staying in 253 evacuation centres while the rest are being hosted by relatives and friends. As of 27 August, Southwest Monsoon is affecting Northern and Central Luzon. The rest of Central Luzon and of Cagayan Valley Region will experience cloudy skies with scattered rains and thunderstorms. It may cause flooding and landslides due to scattered moderate to at times heavy rains. Metro Manila and the rest of the country will experience partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rainshowers caused by localized thunderstorms. It may cause flash floods and landslides due to light to moderate to at times heavy rains. Typhoon Mangkhut (locally named Ompong) made its landfall in Baggao, Cagayan in the early morning of 15 September and is expected to exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility by late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. The typhoon has caused landslides, damage to buildings and homes, and intermittent loss of power. As of 16 September (2 a.m., Manila time), Typhoon Mangkhut has moved towards Southern China, having exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) at 9 p.m. on 15 September. Tropical cyclone warning signals have been lifted, although the Southwest Monsoon may still bring winds and scattered rain over the northern Luzon and Central Visayas region. More than 250,000 people (63,769 families) in 30 provinces across Regions NCR, I, II, III, CALABARZON, MIMAROPA and CAR, are estimated to have been affected by the Typhoon. On 20 September, following days of heavy rains, a steep slope in a quarrying community in Naga City, Cebu, collapsed burying 60 houses in at least eight feet of mud. Local officials report that nine people have been rescued and 25 dead bodies have been recovered. Search and rescue teams from the police and fire services continue to look for 60 more who are trapped under rubble. The local government of Naga City sought assistance from national government in terms of search and rescue operations and establishment of evacuation centres. Some 1,700 people are currently displaced and staying in two evacuation centres. On 3 October, search operations were called off in the northern and central Philippines because excavation efforts at landslide sites have become too dangerous, according to the disaster relief agency. As of 6 Oct, over 8,000 displaced people are staying in 11 evacuation centers around 5 barangays in City of Naga, Cebu. Typhoon Yutu (locally known as Rosita) exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on 31 October. According to PAGASA, it has weakened into a tropical storm and is moving northward 535 km west of northern Luzon. The typhoon entered the PAR on 27 October and made landfall in Dinapigue, Aurora on 30 October, traversed northern Luzon and exited the western seaboard province of La Union in the afternoon. According to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), as of 1 November, 36,660 families (136,647 people) are affected in 1,143 barangays in Region I (Ilocos), Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), Region II (Cagayan Valley), Region III (Central Luzon), and Region VIII (Eastern Visayas). As of 5 November, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reports 11 deaths due mostly to landslides and flooding. Over 65,000 families (more than 254,000 people) were affected in over 1,300 barangays in northern Luzon, and over 7,900 homes damaged in Regions I, III, III, VIII, and the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). As of 9 November, there were 11 confirmed dead and over 2,500 houses destroyed by Typhoon Yutu. Although this storm was not as strong as was initially feared, it affected many of the same communities which were affected by Typhoon Mangkhut in September. There were nearly 1,100 Baranguays affected by both storms which caused repeated displacement across six different provinces. On 20 November, Tropical cyclone THIRTYTHREE (SAMUEL in the Philippines) made landfall as a tropical depression close to Hernani town (Eastern Samar Province, Eastern Visayas Region). SAMUEL continued west over central-eastern Visayas Islands and Visayan Sea, slightly weakening. Heavy rainfall is affecting the Visayas Islands, northern Mindanao and southern Luzon. Tropical Depression Samuel made landfall in Borongan City, Eastern Samar province on Wednesday, November 21, bringing with it moderate to heavy rains. Approximately 34,000 families (124,000 people) were affected by the storm in 294 barangays in Regions V and VIII, with one storm-related death reported in Northern Samar province. Local authorities are leading the relief operations for those affected, with regional and national authorities on standby to support if needed. Tropical Depression Samuel maintained its strength as it moved west across the country, making landfall a total of six times, with maximum winds of 55 km/h and gusts of up to 65 km/h.

Upland Balochistan and Sindh in the south are the most heavily affected by severe drought. These affected areas of Balochistan and Sindh have been prone to water shortages, rainfall measured over the last few years has reached a record low, with minimal or sometimes no rainfall. The abrupt decline in rainfall in most of the upland areas of the province has caused a complete drying up of the surface drinking water resources and has decreased water output from springs and tube wells. Pakistan has experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of drought due a rise in temperatures, adverse effects of El Nino and a decrease in rainfall during the monsoon season.

More than 700 houses were destroyed, several boats and fishing gears damaged and loss of a large number of livestock. This has led to loss of livelihood for most families and may take time and huge financial input to replace the loss.

With this transition, WFP will implement targeted seasonal food assistance for 127,000 people and supplementary feeding programme to prevent chronic malnutrition in children in Grande Anse and Nippes during the lean season from April to June. The Haitian Red Cross Society set up an online platform for information management with support from the IFRC Information Management (IM) Team. This platform is built for information and documents dissemination: Operation: Hurricane Matthew Dashboard. Initially dedicated to common vulnerability analysis, monitoring process and evaluation for all members of the RCRCM, the platform evolved to serve operational and coordination purposes. The backend tool also helped to define the budget and human resources (stored job descriptions) for each sector. Furthermore, the sectors of intervention that have been retained for the recovery phase of the operation (Health, WASH, Shelter, and Livelihoods) are planned and will be implemented in an integrated manner. As of 03 June, areas worst affected by the passage of Hurricane Matthew are likely to remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) through June 2017.

Six months after Hurricane Matthew, WFP is phasing out its emergency response operation which reached more than 100,000 in March 2017 and more than 900,000 people since October 2016, and is planning the transition to recovery programming starting in April. With this transition, WFP will implement targeted seasonal food assistance for 127,000 people and supplementary feeding programme to prevent chronic malnutrition in children in Grande Anse and Nippes during the lean season from April to June. The Haitian Red Cross Society set up an online platform for information management with support from the IFRC Information Management (IM) Team. This platform is built for information and documents dissemination: Operation: Hurricane Matthew Dashboard. Initially dedicated to common vulnerability analysis, monitoring process and evaluation for all members of the RCRCM, the platform evolved to serve operational and coordination purposes. The backend tool also helped to define the budget and human resources (stored job descriptions) for each sector.

According to the Regional Emergency Operations Center in Piura (COER) there are 3,529 people affected by the rains. More than 580 districts of the north coast and mountains are at risk due to the torrential rains, which can cause landslides and mudslides, informed the National Institute of Civil Defense (INDECI). The cyclone Yaku is severely impacting Tumbes, Piura, and Lambayeque departments, generating floods, river overflowing and landslide. The number of casualties is increasing following heavy rainfall, floods and landslides that have been affecting several Departments of Peru since the beginning of March. According to UN OCHA, at least 58 people have died while the National Institute of Civil Defense of Peru reports more than 24,000 affected people and more than 6,400 damaged or destroyed houses. The State of Emergency has been declared in the Departments of Cajamarca, La Libertad, Lambayeque and Piura for the impact due to the huge precipitations. Heavy rainfall has been affecting most of Peru since January 2023, causing floods, rivers to overflow and triggering landslides that have resulted in casualties and damage. The most affected departments are Piura (the worst affected one), Tumbes and Lambayeque in the north and Ayacucho and Arequipa in the south. UN OCHA and the National Center for Estimation, Prevention and Disaster Risk Reduction (CENEPRED) report, as of 27 March, 71 fatalities, nearly 131,000 people in need of humanitarian assistance, around 54,000 damaged houses and 144 destroyed bridges across the country. The Government has declared the state of emergency for 1,030 districts (54 per cent of the total of districts across the country). Tens of thousands of families in the northern departments of Lambayeque, Piura and Tumbes still reeling from recent flooding linked to the El Ni\u00f1o Costero phenomenon continue to withstand heavy rains, forecast to continue battering badly affected coastal communities. Official impact figures continue to grow, with 77 deaths and more than 15,000 homes destroyed. The humanitarian community estimates 517,000 people in need. UN and international NGO teams continue supporting the Government-led response following a request for international assistance. Preliminary findings indicate that shelter, camp coordination and assistance, and delivering assistance to vulnerable migrants and refugees are priority concerns. The floods have directly damaged the homes of some 75,900 families. Education authorities estimate that the disaster has affected educational access for 55,440 children. Social protection services also need support, as Government child protection services personnel are overstretched. Information on shelter conditions and basic needs remains scarce, and the dispersal of the affected population poses a challenge for identifying and responding to protection cases. As of 13 April, the National Civil Defence Institute (INDECI) reports that the floods have affected 246,813 people and left another 42,136 people homeless across the country, according to damage assessments and needs analyses (DANA) records, approximately 53 per cent of which have been processed. Approximately 517,000 people have urgent humanitarian needs, according to preliminary estimates by the National Humanitarian Network (RHN, per its Spanish acronym) as of 29 March, a number that could increase as information continues to come in from the field amid persistent heavy rains. The floods have directly affected more than 114,900 households (about 460,000 people), most of them in the Lambayeque, Piura, and Lima regions. Authorities have declared a state of emergency in 1,056 districts (54 per cent of all districts in Peru). The Ministry of Economy and Finance indicated that the cost of reactivating the economy and responding to the emergency is approximately US$3.1 billion. According to the Emergency Food Security Assessment (EFSA) 2022, 57 per cent of the population (around 16 million people nationwide) suffered from moderate or severe levels of food insecurity prior to the floods. At present, one out of every two people are already using coping strategies to mitigate the floods\u2019 impact to their livelihoods. Any additional impact is likely to exacerbate their situation and cause further food insecurity. The heavy rains have left a total of 65,289 people without homes, 377,190 people affected, 146,539 households affected, 99 dead and 13 missing throughout the country. Between 13 April and 24 April, there was an increase of 130,378 people impacted, according to official data (with 35.5 per cent of the damages and needs records still to be validated). After more than two months, Peru's northern coasts are still reeling from the impacts of heavy rain and flooding. Official records from the National Civil Defence Institute indicate that 584,000 are in need of assistance, a figure that has continued to increase as reports from the field come in. Some 23 per cent of needs and damages assessments are still pending processing. The flooding has also left 31,000 houses destroyed or uninhabitable. According to National Humanitarian Network (RHN) partners, at least 2,600 people are sheltering across the country in 51 centres. With 72 per cent of the damage records accounted for, the Government reports that there are 765,781 people in need. Some 109,027 people are reported to have been rendered homeless and 656,754 affected. In addition, reports indicate that 41,670 homes have been destroyed or rendered uninhabitable. In terms of Food Security and Nutrition, WFP estimates that the emergency is leaving nearly 507,000 people in a state of food insecurity, 73,760 of which are in a state of severe food insecurity. Malnutrition is also growing in Lambayeque, Piura and Tumbes, with figures from the first quarter of 2023 approaching 2021 and 2022 annual figures. With 81 per cent of damage records tallied, the Government reports 801,425 people in need of assistance since the start of the rainy season in January. Additionally, 45,101 homes have been either destroyed or rendered uninhabitable. Food, water, sanitation and hygiene services, health, protection and the situation of 1,350 people in 24 shelters, both official and makeshift, remain priority needs. As of 17 July 2023, the Peru Civil Protection (INDECI per its acronym in Spanish), published updated information on the heavy rains affecting several departments in Peru, including Moquegua reporting affected persons and homes for the first time. With 100 per cent of damage records tallied, the Government reports 839,760 people in need since the start of the rainy season in January, an increase of 38,335 people.

On 22 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) notified WHO of cases of yellow fever (YF) in connection with the outbreak currently occurring in Angola. From early January to 22 March 2016, a total of 151 suspected cases of YF, including 21 deaths (CFR: 14%), were reported by the national surveillance system. Of the 151 suspected cases, 9 were confirmed by serology (IgM) at the Institute National Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa. Given possible cross-reactions with other arboviruses, IgM positive samples were sent to the Pasteur Institute of Dakar for confirmation where 4 tested positive for the infection. Of the 4 cases confirmed in Dakar, 3 were imported from Angola and were detected in the areas of Nsona-Pangu, Kimpese and Kitona in Kongo Central province (formerly, Bas-Congo), DRC. This province shares borders with Angola. As of 15 July 2016 a total of 3682 suspected cases have been reported, of which 877 are confirmed.

Crop failure due to low rainfall, coupled with loss of small animals has greatly reduced the impoverished communities\u2019 purchasing power. Poverty is endemic in the sparsely populated district with acute malnutrition rates in children as high as 20 per cent, well above the emergency threshold of 15 per cent. The outbreak of sheep pox has aggravated the situation in Tharparkar, possibly having killed thousands of small animals, critical to household food security. More than 190 children have died and 22,000 have been hospitalised in Tharparkar district in 2016 because of drought-related waterborne and viral diseases. Tharparkar is facing severe drought for the fourth consecutive year, and access to health services is reported to be very difficult, with families travelling an average distance of 17km to reach the nearest health facility. According to the Joint UN Needs Assessment, several districts have been severely affected by extreme water scarcity (62% in Jamshoro and 100% in Tharparkar), and it has resulted in reduced harvest by 34-53% and livestock by 48%. In Tharparkar District and the surrounding areas of Sindh Province, a third consecutive year of cereal production shortfalls due to drought, coupled with losses of small animals, has aggravated food insecurity and caused acute malnutrition. Since 2013, Tharparkar has been affected by a drought\u2010like situation impacting livelihoods, nutrition and health conditions. The total under\u2010 5 deaths were reported at 234 in 2013, 326 in 2014, and 398 in 2015, rising from 173 in 2011 and 188 in 2012. According to media reports, the incidence of under\u2010five deaths in Tharparkar is still on rise during the first half of 2016 with 243 deaths recorded. This may suggest a worsening health and nutrition situation following the start of the drought period. At least nine more infants died due to malnutrition and the outbreak of various diseases in arid Tharparkar district over a two-day period in December, raising the toll to 476 for 2016, according to local media. A joint UN observation mission took place in drought-hit Tharparkar, Umerkot and Sanghar districts from 13-17 February, 2017. The resulting mission report stated that the areas remain vulnerable and that the situation may become critical or deteriorate into a 'humanitarian emergency' if little or no rain falls during the coming monsoon, and if immediate needs are not met. The mission found that the vulnerabilities outlined in an August 2016 needs assessment remain, while recommendations from detailed assessments and missions conducted from 2015-2016 have not been put into practice. In the districts of Tharparkar, Umerkot and Sanghar in southeastern Sindh Province, below-average rains throughout 2016 sharply reduced the 2016/17 cereal production. This, coupled with losses of small animals due to diseases and severe shortages of fodder and water, has aggravated food insecurity and caused acute malnutrition. Forecast models indicate that there is a 50 to 60 per cent probability of an El Ni\u00f1o event developing in the second half of 2017, with Pakistan categorized as a high-risk country. Worsening drought conditions could potentially affect an estimated 300,000 of the most vulnerable people \u2014 including 192,680 children \u2014 in Sindh province.

Of great concern is former Greater Jonglei State, where food security is rapidly deteriorating, predominantly in the counties of Ayod, Canal/Pigi, Duk, Nyirol and Uror, which are facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) acute food insecurity, with Ayod having an estimated 20,000 people experiencing Humanitarian Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) at least through July 2017. In September 2017, 6 million people were in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5), which corresponded to 56% of the total population. As for October to December 2017, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance (IPC phase 3 and above) are expected to drop to 4.8 million (45% of the total population. However, this figure includes a doubled number of people classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) compared to the same time last year, and 25,000 people still experiencing catastrophic conditions and extreme food gaps. WFP resumed the integrated rapid response mechanism (IRRM) and currently has seven teams deployed in Bilkey, Nyandit, Kurwai, Jaibor, Chuil, Buot and Ulang, providing life-saving food and nutrition assistance to around 96,633 people, including 17,370 children under the age of five. WFP plans to deploy an additional 26 missions in the coming six weeks, targeting close to 400,000. An estimated 5.3 million people, 48 percent of the population, are currently facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse acute food insecurity, despite the harvest and continued large-scale assistance. In September 2018, 6.1 million people (59% of the total population) are facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3), Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). During the post-harvest period October-December 2018, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance (IPC Phase 3 and above) is expected to reduce to 4.4 million (43% of the total population), out of which 26,000 will be experiencing catastrophic conditions (IPC Phase 5) and extreme food gaps. By January-March 2019, 5.2 million people (49% of the total population) are estimated to continue to face acute food insecurity, with 36,000 people in catastrophic conditions (IPC Phase 5). In the current analysis period of January 2019, 6.17 million people (54% of the population) are estimated to have faced Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity or worse, out of which 1.36 million people faced Emergency (IPC Phase 4) acute food insecurity and 30,000 faced Catastrophe (IPC phase 5). In the projection period of February to April 2019, and in the presence of Humanitarian Food Assistance (HFA), a total of 6.45 million people (57% of the population) will face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity or worse, with an estimated 45,000 people in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes persist throughout South Sudan, and some households are likely in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). According to the May IPC analysis, an estimated 6.96 million people are estimated to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through the July/August peak of the lean season in the presence of already planned humanitarian assistance. Food security will improve somewhat in late 2019 with the harvest, though Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes will remain widespread. A risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) will also persist. The seasonal availability of the harvest, wild foods, fish, and livestock products is expected to sustain relatively improved food security outcomes in January. However, food security is expected to deteriorate from February to May as these sources of food decline. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) will likely be widespread as many households experience widening food consumption gaps and increase the use of coping strategies. Emergency (IPC Phase 4) is expected in 16 counties in Jonglei, Upper Nile, Unity, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, and Eastern Equatoria states. In this period, more than 5.5 million people are anticipated to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes in the presence of humanitarian food assistance. As the 2020 lean season progresses, it is possible that some host, IDP, or refugee households would experience Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) without humanitarian food assistance. In February, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes remain widespread in South Sudan. According to the January 2020 IPC acute analysis, the acutely food insecure population is expected to reach 6.01 million people in early 2020 even in the presence of humanitarian food assistance. This number includes 20,000 people who are likely in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) in Akobo and Duk counties of Jonglei state. The scale and severity of acute food insecurity in South Sudan through January 2021 is expected to remain among the highest recorded since 2014. Urgent, sustained humanitarian food assistance beyond currently planned levels is required to save lives and protect livelihoods in the ongoing lean season and post-harvest periods. Unprecedented levels of inter-communal conflict, the macroeconomic crisis, recurrent flooding, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and preventive measures are leading to Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and worse outcomes. The country is now facing its highest levels of food insecurity and malnutrition since independence 10 years ago. The latest food security analysis estimates that the 2021 lean season, between April and July, will be the worst ever in terms of severity, with 108,000 people in catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). A total of 7.7 million people are expected to need food assistance, including 7.24 million acutely food insecure South Sudanese in rural areas, 130,000 people in urban areas and 314,000 refugees in South Sudan. An estimated 1.4 million children and 480,000 pregnant or lactating women will be acutely malnourished and in need of treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated people\u2019s existing vulnerabilities and weakened an already fragile health system\u2019s ability to treat people. South Sudan is one of the worst hunger crises globally, with 2.5 million people in emergency or worse levels of acute food insecurity, of which 108,000 people are estimated to already face famine-like conditions. Considering also the 4.7 million people in crisis levels, this is worst food security situation since the 2011 independence. Conflict is a main driver of food insecurity, and households' purchasing power is further diminished by high inflation.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"WFP resumed the integrated rapid response mechanism (IRRM) and currently has seven teams deployed in Bilkey, Nyandit, Kurwai, Jaibor, Chuil, Buot and Ulang, providing life-saving food and nutrition assistance to around 96,633 people, including 17,370 children under the age of five.

Furthermore, on 16 January, lava flow and more rockfall events and short pyroclastic flows were also observed.

As of 22 January, 7,900 families (30,000 people) have evacuated from seven Albay municipalities neighbouring Mount Mayon. On 24 Jan 2018, the danger zone has been further extended to a 9 km radius. Around 60,500 people have been displaced and are sheltered in 52 evacuation centres or are being hosted by relatives and friends. As of 29 January, nearly 90,000 people have been evacuated from their homes due to ongoing eruptions at Mount Mayon. The majority of displaced people are staying in 74 evacuation centres. Lack of drinking water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene and dignity kits have been noted in areas where evacuees are staying. The Department of Agriculture has provided farm supplies and materials to 10,500 affected farmers. Medical missions and psychosocial activities, as well as food and non-food items, are being delivered at the emergency centres for displaced people. The health department has deployed a team from the regional and provincial health offices to reassess the health conditions in evacuation centers, while NGOs are conducting psychosocial activities for children living inside evacuation centers. The social welfare and development office has distributed 3,000 food packs and tents for temporary shelter. Providing education to children displaced by the volcano and supporting the livelihoods of farmers with land in the six to nine-kilometer permanent danger zone, remain key priorities. On 6 March 2018, the alert level of the volcano has been downgraded to Level 3 due to declining in unrest reflected by moderate seismicity and degassing, deflation of the edifice, and a decrease in eruptive activity at the summit crater. As of 8 March 2018, over 49,000 people are still taking shelter in 48 evacuation centers. 54,000 evacuees have returned home after the alert for the Mayon volcano was reduced to level 3.

More than 2,300 houses collapsed, and 19,000 were damaged to varying degrees. The direct economic loss was 3.6 billion Yuan. On 12 July 2018, the Provincial Disaster Reduction Commission selected four technical persons and two satellite commanding vehicles - carrying unmanned aerial vehicles and 4G communications equipment - to collect unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing data with the working group. According to this rapid assessment, heavy rainfall has resulted in a large number of seriously damaged houses that have continued to collapse in these two provinces. More rain has been falling over the past week, worsening the flood situation. The flooding season will continue until the end of August and more rain can be expected until then. China Meteorological Administration activated a level three emergency response to address Typhoon Ampil. It is required that the relevant meteorological sectors attached to CMA enter the emergency position immediately and put corresponding meteorological services in place. The potential affected areas such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Anhui are expected to sustain or adjust the corresponding emergency state according to local realities. On 22 July, National Meteorological Center reported that Typhoon Ampil has made landfall at the coastal regions of Chongming Island, Shanghai. The maximum wind intensity at the center registered 28 m/s. The minimum air pressure registered 985 pHa. In northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, more than 5,200 residents have been evacuated as torrential rain has battered Helan Mountain since 22 July. The maximum rainfall during this period reached 277.6 millimeters in Helan Mountain, and floods have formed in the eastern areas at the foot of the mountain. In north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, floods triggered by torrential rain have left 12 people dead and three others missing as of 23 July. The regional meteorological observatory has issued a red alert for rainstorms, warning that rainfall will continue in the following days and may cause floods and landslides in cities and towns. The water level in the section of Lanzhou, the capital city of northwest China's Gansu Province, along the Yellow River, has risen rapidly due to heavy rain. On 31 July, twenty people died in floods caused by torrential rain in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Another eight people remain missing after the downpours hit Qincheng Township in Hami according to the regional disaster relief headquarters. Over 5,500 residents have been evacuated and provided with tents, daily necessities and medical treatment in temporary relocation sites.

A drought warning is in place and the Government reports at least 30,000 people are now affected. Other El Ni\u00f1o effects include a drought declaration in Tonga after extremely dry weather for nearly a year and further low rainfall expected for the rest of the year. Emergency water supplies were distributed to the outer islands and water desalination services are available if needed. Current estimates suggest that 4.3 million people in 12 Pacific countries could be at risk from changed rainfall patterns caused by El Ni\u00f1o (drought and increased rainfall). Fiji are reliant on water deliveries as a result of the country\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o-related drought in Western, Eastern and Northern divisions of Fiji. A drought watch has recently been cancelled in the Solomon Islands after recent rainfall which started before Christmas. However, there remain food security concerns after repeated interruptions to crop cultivation as a result of cyclones, floods and drought conditions last year. Many parts of Micronesia are entering a period of moderate to severe drought as El Ni\u00f1o impacts continue to be felt. Lower than normal rainfall during the coming months will cause drought to develop in the Mariana Islands and parts of Chuuk state. Drought is already affecting Palau and Yap State. A dry trade-wind pattern will also cause increasingly dry conditions across the Marshall Islands. Below normal rainfall is expected across the region until later in the year. The Marshall Islands declared a state of emergency in February after 13 atolls have formally requested assistance from the National Government to address water shortage challenges associated with the droughts. Over the past several weeks, extreme drought was reported in eight atolls across the Marshall Islands including Wotje and Utirik. As of 20 April, the drought has affected an estimated 6,400 people. On 24 April, the Government declared a State of Emergency for 31 days in the affected areas. The Emergency Operations Centre was activated and is coordinating the response with local governments and national clusters. Authorities are liaising with bilateral partners to support the in-country response. Palau became the latest country in the north Pacific to declare an El Ni\u00f1o-related State of Emergency. In a statement, the President reported that the total rainfall in the state of Koror over the past four months was the lowest recorded since 1951. The Ngerimel Dam has run out of water while the only other remaining source of freshwater, the Ngerikiil River, is at a critically low level. Koror and Airai are on an emergency water-rationing schedule, permitting three hours of water access each morning and evening. Water rationing was also initiated in other parts of the country. Vanuatu has been grappling with drought since mid-2015 with many of the affected areas being the same as those that were hit by Category 5 Cyclone Pam in March 2015, thus reducing communities\u2019 resilience to further shocks. Reasonable rain over recent months has eased water concerns across the country but food security remains an ongoing issue in some areas. As Vanuatu is moving into its traditional dry season, there are still concerns that food gardens may not be able to supply sufficient produce to keep all areas and populations appropriately fed later 2016. Papua New Guinea was impacted by the El Ni\u00f1o climatic phenomenon from mid-2015 to 2016, causing the affected areas to experience less than average rainfall and a series of frost events. The prolonged anomalous weather pattern has resulted in water shortages and crop damage in a number of localities, particularly in the Highland provinces. In 2015, the European Commission made over \u20ac1,260,000 available to enable its partners to provide relief and build resilience amongst the most vulnerable communities. Overall, a total of 75,000 individuals benefited from this aid, which included health and nutrition support, as well as access to clean water and the provision of water and hygiene kits. Farmers also benefited from training on drought resilient agricultural methods. As the dry spell has continued into mid-2016, affecting the food security of close to 1.5 million people nationwide, a further \u20ac2 million has been released to support a food assistance initiative by the World Food Programme (WFP). The aid focuses on meeting urgent food needs of 180,000 people in drought-affected areas. In October 2016, the World Food Programme announced that it had concluded its food distributions in Papua New Guinea, having reached more than 246,000 people in the highlands as well as Western and Milne Bay Provinces. WFP documented visible signs of recovery as well as anecdotal evidence suggesting the return of crops to areas once affected by drought. However, evidence of the extent of the recovery was limited \u2014while the El Ni\u00f1o event has officially ended, some subsistence farmers reported that they did not expect kaukau (sweet potato) yields until December 2016. WFP will begin an assessment in November 2016 to monitor the extent of the recovery. In Kiribati, a drought situation is affecting several areas including Butaritari, Beru and Kirimati. An emergency situation has not yet been declared. Low water levels are also reported in Nauru, Tokelau and Tuvalu. According to the Australia Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Outlook, there is around a 50 per cent chance (twice the normal likelihood) of an El Ni\u00f1o event developing in 2017. Since the beginning of 2017, sea surface temperatures have continued to warm in the Pacific. To mitigate the potential impact of El Ni\u00f1o, countries in the Pacific, including Papua New Guinea, have started to initiate preparedness activities. In 2016, at least 11 countries across the Asia-Pacific region were affected by severe weather events associated with El Ni\u00f1o. While the effects of El Ni\u00f1o have not been consistent they have generally comprised of extended dry spells or drought leading to water shortages, prolonged lean seasons and food shortages. According to the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme, a regional sustainable development body, five of eight surveyed models indicated El Ni\u00f1o is likely to form by the third quarter of 2017. The effects of an El Ni\u00f1o event are different for each country. Generally, however, El Ni\u00f1o events are usually associated with lower rainfall with the possibility of droughts, dust, and increased bushfires in countries like Fiji, New Caledonia, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu in the Western Pacific. In the Eastern Pacific, including countries like Kiribati, Nauru, Northern Cook Islands and Tuvalu, El Ni\u00f1o events are usually associated with higher rainfall\u2014likely leading to flooding, infrastructure damage and the pollution of water sources.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Emergency water supplies were distributed to the outer islands and water desalination services are available if needed.

The floods are not yet past their peak and are expected to intensify and occur in several more regions. Severe flooding, mainly due to rapid snow melting caused by warm temperature, continues to affect south-western Russia and the neighbouring north-western Kazakhstan since early April, resulting in casualties and widespread damage. The flooding also worsened after a dam broke on 5 April in the area of Orsk City (south-eastern Orenburg region) and by river embankment failures, particularly of the Volga, Ural, Tobol and Ishim rivers. In Kazakhstan, national authorities and IFRC report two fatalities, approximately 86,000 affected people and around 3,400 flooded houses across several regions. The most affected area is the Atyrau region. State authorities declared local state of emergency in 30 locations of 10 regions. More than 86,000 people have been evacuated and more than 3,700 private houses remain flooded. Over 8,400 people, including 4,000 children, have been placed in temporary accommodation centres, such as schools and social adaptation centres. Fifty-nine settlements remain without transport and communication. The floods have killed 5,711 heads of livestock, 1,013 of which have already been buried.

The state has also mobilised the army, police, and the national guard to support in evacuations, water pumping, and establishing water protection constructions. Severe floods and flash floods continue to affect south-western Russia and the neighbouring north-western Kazakhstan since 3 April, resulting in more evacuated people and severe damage. In Kazakhstan, the Ministry of Emergency Situations reports, as of 15 April, nearly 111,200 evacuated people (of which over 6,800 in a number of evacuation centres), approximately 5,500 flooded houses, around 180 flooded roads and nine collapsed bridges across Akmola, Aktobe, Kostanay, Atyrau and North Kazakhstan Regions. As at 17 April, the flooding continued, with water still not receding in the flood-affected regions. Work to protect riverbanks and discharge water also continued. The flooding is a result of rapid snow melting and river flooding. As at 19 April, floods had evacuated or displaced approximately 118,200 people, almost 44,300 of whom were children, and inundated around 6,000 homes. By 22 April, around 24,500 people had returned to their homes, while 8,850 remained in shelters. As at 18 April, the flooding had killed seven people. Since March 2024 Northern and Western Kazakhstan has been awfully affected by the floods. Dams were breached and reservoirs overflowed, causing widespread devastation and displacing over 119,000 people, including 44,000 children. The situation in Atyrau reached its peak on May 24, when a dam broke down, requiring the erection of another protective structure and the deployment of supplementary equipment. Nineteen families, comprising approximately 130 individuals, are temporarily housed in a school, lacking resources for renting accommodations or relying on relatives. More than 118,000 people have been evacuated, while more than 12,000 residential buildings and over 7,000 summer houses have been flooded.

In Quang Ngai, flood water level was 1m above Alarm Level II. Many families are reported to be waiting on the roofs of their houses to be rescued in Hue and other provinces. The historic town of Hoi An is also seriously flooded. By early morning of 2 November, the offices of the Red Cross in Hue and Quang Tri were flooded by over 1m of water in Hue and 0.5m in Quang Tri. No confirmation of the number of lives lost, persons missing or material losses is available at this time, but judging from previous years, figures are likely to be high. On 5 November the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC) reported at least 233 deaths resulting from more than a fortnight of flooding in central Vietnam. Accurate figures are impossible owing to interrupted communication lines, but it is known that more than 255,299 houses have collapsed and 15,000 households have been evacuated. At least 6,477 ha of paddy fields have been damaged by the deluge, and 5,588 ha definitively lost. According to the CCFSC, 32,830 tons of food have gone to waste. Provisional statistics provided by the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC) as of 7 November estimate that 535 people have died as a result of the fortnight's flooding, 324 of whom lived in the province of Thua Thien Hue. Accurate figures are impossible owing to interrupted communication lines, but it is known that more than 8,346 houses have collapsed and another 604,204 others have been affected. 15,000 people have been evacuated. One month after the worst floods Vietnam has experienced this century, new, extensive floods have been an additional blow to the same region. This second bout of flood occurred just as relief and rehabilitation measures were being undertaken in order to help stabilize the lives of the people affected by the previous floods. According to the update issued by the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC) on 8 December, the new floods caused by heavy rainfall from 1 to 6 December once again attained historical water levels in some rivers in the central provinces from Thua Thien Hue to Khanh Hoa, unsurpassed in the last 40 years. Quang Ngai and Quang Nam are the two most seriously affected provinces; here rainfall averaged as much as 2,000 mm and caused destructive inundation. On 7 December the rainfall diminished and floodwater levels in all the rivers of the central provinces have been receding. According to the Hydro-Meteorological Service forecast, floodwater levels in the rivers flowing through Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh will remain at alarm level III, while rivers in the other provinces will remain at alarm level II or below.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Relief and rehabilitation measures were being undertaken to help stabilize the lives of the people affected by the floods.

According to media reports, 38 people have died (most of them in the Alta Verapaz Department with ten fatalities), 15 people are still missing, five have been injured, and 2.3 million have been affected. For the next 24 hours, moderate to heavy rain is forecast over most parts of the country, particularly over the southern Departments. Heavy rainfall and strong winds have been affecting most of the country since the beginning of the rainy season (mid-April) causing floods, landslides and a number of severe weather-related incidents that have resulted in casualties and damage.

Since 28 March, flash floods following heavy rain affected 18 provinces in north-central and west regions of Afghanistan. Preliminary information suggests that floods have killed 11 people, while 15 people are injured. Most affected provinces are Farah, Badghis, Faryab, Baghlan, Takhar and Parwan. Needs assessments are coordinated by the local authorities and humanitarian agencies. The flash floods displaced families. At least 288 houses were completely destroyed, and 400 houses were partially damaged. Furthermore 500 hectares of agricultural crops were washed away. OCHA\u2019s natural disaster tracking dashboard shows that more than 15,300 people have been affected by floods (13,900), landslides (616) and avalanches (819) since the start of the year. During flood-related displacement, host communities tend to extend their limited resources to families in need. Most displaced families are normally hosted by relatives or in neighbouring communities while they wait for the rain to subside prior to starting repair of their shelters. This coping mechanism creates favourable conditions for higher transmission of COVID-19 and in some cases may give rise to protection concerns for displaced people and their hosts. This is particularly concerning for the country\u2019s west and south bordering Iran and Pakistan where flooding is already taking place. IOM and other ES-NFI partners have so far conducted 127 joint assessments in areas affected by floods. Assessment findings showed that more than 1,400 homes have been either damaged or destroyed. ES-NFI partners have further mobilised rapid shelter support and distribution of household items to 9,366 people affected by floods. With the onset of the rainy season, severe flooding was reported across many provinces in Afghanistan over the past week. Provincial authorities and humanitarian partners coordinated joint needs assessments to reach affected areas and respond to humanitarian needs. To date, 480 families (approximately 3,360 people) were provided with emergency shelter and household items. Torrential rain affected several parts of the country over the last month, causing flash floods, triggering landslides and leading to casualties. The most affected Provinces were Badakhshan, Badghis, Baghlan, Farah, Faryab, Parwan, Takhar and Ghor. According to media reports, at least 56 people have died, 31 have been injured. Approximately 600 houses have been destroyed and over 3,000 partially damaged. Heavy rains in Kunar Province resulted in casualties and house damages. On 17 April, six members of the same family reportedly died in Khas Kunar district when the roof of a house collapsed due to heavy rains in eastern Kunar Province. Provincial authorities assisted affected families with food and non-food items. Also, flash flooding was reported in Dangam, Bar Kunar, Shigal districts. Initial reports showed that around 300 people were impacted. Since the beginning of the year, 17,000 people have been affected by flash floods and heavy rainfalls across Afghanistan, and almost 1,800 houses were damaged or destroyed, in addition to agricultural lands. Recently, over 800 families (approximately 4,200 people) were affected by flash floods in Badghis province and their needs are currently being assessed. As of 5 of May, flash floods triggered by heavy rain have affected Baghlan province (northern Afghanistan), resulting in fatalities and damage to buildings. According to media reports, the worst hit area is Tala Wa Barfak District (south-western Baghlan), where 4 people died and houses, farmlands and infrastructure were damaged. Search and rescue operations are ongoing. As of 17 of May, Interagency assessment teams verified 1,407 people affected by landslides in Faryab province and 1,379 people displaced by conflict in Balkh, Faryab, Sar-e-Pul and Jawzjan provinces. In addition, 4,760 people affected by flash floods received humanitarian assistance in Faryab and Samangan provinces. As of 28 May, flash floods affected at least 329 people in Badakhshan and Baghlan provinces, and destroyed 200 houses, agriculture lands and affected nearly 1,400 people in Sar-e-Pul province. On 23 June, heavy rains and localized flash floods impacted 945 people (135 families) in Kunar, Laghman and Nangarhar resulting in casualties and material damages. The Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) reported that three children died in Nari district and Khas Kunar district, Kunar province. Several houses were reportedly damaged and agricultural land and crops were extensively damaged in Nari and Nurgal districts in Kunar province. Two other children were reportedly killed by lightning. Humanitarian partners are already providing assistance to people affected by flash floods. On 24 June 2020, a thunderstorm struck killing two children in Batikot and Shinwar districts in Nangarhar province. ANDMA in Nangarhar provided immediate assistance (relief items and food assistance) to affected families. ANDMA has announced that it will provide a further 50,000 AFs to affected families. Flash floods triggered by heavy rain were reported in Nangarhar Province (eastern Afghanistan) on 31 July. According to media, the worst-hit area is Kuz Kunar District (northern Nangarhar), where at least 16 people died and dozens of houses were damaged. Additional floods have been reported also in Parwan Province (central-eastern Afghanistan) where homes and roads were damaged or destroyed. As per the initial reports from the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA); 495 families were affected by flash flood in Charikar provincial center on 2 August. Due to heavy rainfall, 26 families were reportedly affected in Marwawara, Shigal, Asadabad and Nurgal districts on 2 August. 48 families were affected by flood in Alishang, Alingar and Mihtarlam districts on 2 August.

The country, mainly arid, is experiencing highest level of drought compared to its Sahel neighbours. This situation is considered the worst since 2012. It is aggravated by the increase in the price of basic foodstuff. All resulting from the sharp rise in acquisition costs on world markets and the disruption of supplies due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis in Ukraine. There is an important increase in the price of basket food in a population with a decreasing purchasing power.

The KRCS has confirmed that at least 14,000 people have been displaced who were living in low-lying areas where rivers have burst their banks. At least 29 flood-related deaths have been reported and the death toll and number of people displaced is expected to rise in the days ahead as further information is received and verified from affected areas. 43,000 people have been affected in Wajir County (north-east Kenya) and the number of flood-related deaths has increased to 29.

With the current weather forecasts, which predicts heavy rains until the end of November, the NDOC expects these numbers to rise, including affecting 200,000 refugees living in settlements in Dadaab. Heavy rain has been affecting western Kenya, triggering landslides that have resulted in casualties and widespread damage. As of 26 November, at least 52 fatalities after major landslides occurred on 24 November in Tapach, Weiwei and Batei Wards Villages (West Pokot County). Around 45 people are reportedly still missing. More than 160,000 people, including nearly 18,000 who are displaced countrywide, have been affected by floods or landslides since the onset of the short rains in October, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). At least 120 people have reportedly died, including 72 people who lost their lives after a landslide buried their houses in West Pokot County in northwestern Kenya, according to the Government. Infrastructure of undetermined value, including roads and bridges, have been damaged, hampering effective humanitarian response efforts in affected areas. UNICEF has sent supplies in response to the heavy rains and floods experienced in Kenya since mid-October, bringing relief to around 130,000 affected people.

Damage to essential infrastructure including roads, schools and health facilities has disrupted access to critical services for children and families. From October to December, Kenya experienced one of the wettest short rains seasons on record, with rainfall totals ranging up to 400 percent of average. A second round of floods and landslides in November caused the death of 132 people, displaced 17,000 people, and affected approximately 330,000 people, primarily in West Pokot.

The tremor has been felt by residents of the cities of Salmas, Chaldoran, Chaypareh, Poldasht, and Uroumia. Due to active faults in numerous locations of the country, Iran is prone to several disasters, including earthquakes. The activated fault in this location that generated the earthquake is known as Siyah Cheshme-Khoy.

Widespread damage has been reported to nearly 10,570 houses, and about 100 classrooms, disrupting access to education for a number of students. Several communities in northern and central Madagascar have been isolated, as roads have been damaged by floods or landslides. Tropical cyclone CHENESO continues to strengthen, and on 25 January at 1.00 UTC, its centre was located on the Mozambique Channel, about 135 km west of coastal Morondava City (Menabe Region, central-western Madagascar). Over the next three days, CHENESO is expected to intensify, while moving south over the Mozambique Channel, not far from the Malagasy coast. On 25-26 January, light to moderate rainfall is expected over north-western, central-western, and south-eastern Madagascar. Madagascar is still impacted by the passage of CHENESO as a tropical storm on 19-23 January, resulting in at least 16 fatalities, and 19 missing people, as reported by BNGRC. The number of temporarily displaced people stands at 26,000 individuals, while about 55,000 people have been affected, as material damage includes 13,350 houses, 18 medical centres, and more than 100 classrooms. Many settlements continue to be isolated. The centre of tropical storm CHENESO was located on 27 January at 7.00 UTC on the Mozambique Channel, about 160 km of south-western Madagascar. After the passage of tropical cyclone CHENESO on 19-23 January, the figures of affected people continue to increase as the water level is rising in the South-Western parts of the country. Access to the affected people remains a challenge. At least 33 people died and 20 others are reported as missing across 17 regions of Madagascar, after floods, landslides, and strong winds caused by the passage of tropical cyclone CHENESO on 19-21 January.

The declaration, coming out of the 66th session of the WHO Regional Committee for the African Region, demonstrates commitment from governments across the region to bolster momentum in the fight against the virus. Nigeria has mobilized its immunization forces and will look to take heed of four key lessons earned during almost three decades of anti-polio efforts: 1) establishing and sustaining trust is critical to the success of eradication campaigns; 2) frequent, independent monitoring and evaluation are key to tracking the progress of an intervention and making modifications; 3) holding all actors accountable is essential to pushing an intervention forward; and 4) contextualized health initiatives are key in fighting polio and other diseases. These lessons will reinforce a cohesive, multilateral strategy that builds on past successes to secure a polio-free Nigeria. The coverage data of the 5th polio outbreak response from early December reports more than 90 per cent polio vaccination coverage in the 81% of the Local Government Areas (LGAs) surveyed in Borno state. The 6th polio campaign in Borno state (between 16 -19 December) took place in 24 of the 27 LGAs in Borno state (except Marte, Abadam and Mobbar) and in all the 17 LGAs in Yobe State. Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains four and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 August 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno. The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin. Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region. These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders. Phase 3 of outbreak response is being launched in January 2018, taking into account the recommendations made during the November Outbreak Response Assessments for the countries and the Technical Advisory Group meeting in December. One new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed in Nigeria this week, occurring in Kaugama district, Jigawa state, with onset on 15 April 2018. One new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week, from Nganzai Local Government Area, Borno state, with onset of paralysis on 13 July. Two new cVDPV2-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, one from Yobe state, and one from Sokoto state. Three new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported this week, bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 to eleven. These latest reported cases all had onset of paralysis in August, from Katsina and Borno states, linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak centred around Jigawa. Additionally, two new cVDPV2-environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Yobe state, collected on 7 and 18 August. No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported. The most recently-detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on 21 August 2016. In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus is detected. Three new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases have been reported bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 to 14. These latest reported cases had onset of paralysis in late August and early September, from Katsina and Yobe states, linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak centred around Jigawa. Two new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in week 45 (week ending 11 November 2018), one from Katsina State and one from Kaduna State (newly infected district and province, part of the Jigawa outbreak) with onset of paralysis on 9 October 2018 and 10 September 2018 respectively. One new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case was reported this week (ending on 18 December 2018) from Zango LGA, Katsina State, with date of onset of paralysis on 5 November. The country continues to be affected by two separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the first centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the second in Sokoto state. One new case has been confirmed in a 3-year-old girl with onset of paralysis on 5 December 2018 from Baruten Local Government Area (LGA), Kwara State, located on the border with Benin. The country continues to be affected by two separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the first centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the second in Sokoto state. Two cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 have been reported this week in Konduga LGA, Borno State and Baruten LGA, Kwara State with onset of paralysis reported on 14 February and 20 February 2019 respectively. There are now four cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 so far. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34. There are eight cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 so far. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34. The country is now affected by three separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the first centered in Jigawa State with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, the second in Sokoto State and the third one in Bauchi State. As of 22 July 2019, 50 samples from the environment have tested positive for cVDPV2 while the virus has been isolated from the stool samples of 23 children who presented with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) or in healthy community contacts. The last case of wild polio virus (WPV) was reported in Borno state in August 2016. There are 16 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019. There were 34 cVDPV2 cases in 2018. One cVDPV2-positive environmental sample was reported from Ilorin East LGA, Kwara State. The sample was collected on 27 August 2019. One case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported from Anambra province making it the first case in 2020.

Two cases of cVDPV2 and three cases of cVDPV3 have been confirmed, one of which is confirmed as having co-infection of cVDPV2. The total number of cases is four. Humanitarian partners and health authorities have stepped up efforts to vaccinate every child under the age of five in Somalia against polio as part of attempts to stem the spread of the circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus (cVDPV) associated with populations with low immunity levels and poor hygiene. Four cases of cVDPV have been reported this year. An unknown number of Somali children remain unvaccinated due to access challenges, creating a conducive environment in which VDPVs can thrive. One new cVDPV type 2 case was confirmed this week. Virus was isolated from a contact of child that developed paralysis on the 02 September 2018. These children are both from an inaccessible area of Lower Juba, Somalia. Detailed investigations are underway to determine the best response mechanism. No type 3 cases have been reported this week. The total number of cVDPV cases is eleven (11): five cVDPV2, five cVDPV3 and one case of a child with a coinfection of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 virus. A nationwide polio vaccination campaign targeting around 2.6 million children under five with bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine is (bOPV) underway this week. One new cVDPV type 3 case was confirmed this week. Virus was isolated from a child with AFP that developed paralysis on 07 September 2018. This five month old child is from an inaccessible area of Middle Shabelle, Somalia, and had never received polio vaccination previously. Detailed investigations are underway to determine the best response mechanism across the area; no type 2 cases have been reported this week. The total number of cVDPV cases is 12: five cVDPV2, six cVDPV3 and one case of a child with a coinfection of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 virus. The current polio outbreak that has left twelve (12) Somali children paralyzed are of the highest priority for humanitarian partners\u2019 action. No new cases of circulating vaccine derived polio virus (cVDPV) were discovered in November. Since the first discovery in January 2018, health partners have conducted ten (10) targeted vaccination campaigns, the latest was conducted in nine (9) districts in South and Central Somalia from 25 \u2013 28 November 2018; seeking to cover approximately 1.5M children. A new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)* case was confirmed from an AFP case from Las Anod district in Sool region, Somaliland. The date of onset of paralysis was 15th March 2019 (with final classification results released on 23rd April 2019); The latest case to be detected is considered to be a continuation of the existing outbreak of cVDPV2. Prior to this detection, the last cVDPV2 case had a date of onset of 2 September 2018; A total of 13 cases have been identified in the concurrent outbreaks (6 cVDPV2 and 6 cVPDV3, with one additional child with coinfection of type 2 and 3); The Somalia Polio Programme has not confirmed any new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) since 8 May 2019. The last case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) in a child with AFP was detected and confirmed on 7 September 2018. A total of three cVDPV2 cases have been reported in Somalia across 2019. In total, 15 children with polio have been detected in Somalia since the onset of the ongoing concurrent cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 outbreaks in 2017. A cVDPV2 outbreak in the Horn of Africa has been detected in Somali province, Ethiopia. The virus was isolated from an AFP case with onset of paralysis on 20 May 2019. Genetic sequencing confirms that the isolated virus is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak detected in the Horn of Africa in 2018, with cases reported in Somalia as well as from an environmental sample in Kenya. Currently, Somalia has reported three cVDPV2 cases in 2019. Since detection of the cVDPVs in the Horn of Africa in 2018, Ethiopia had declared this outbreak \u2013 together with the Ministries of Health of Kenya and Somalia \u2013 to be a regional public health emergency and has been participating in regional outbreak response. Given cross-border population movements across the Horn of Africa specifically between Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia, as well as suboptimal subnational immunity and surveillance gaps, the Horn of Africa is considered at high-risk of further transmission of this cVDPV2. No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week. The onsets of paralysis of the last case was on 9 September 2019. A total of five cVDPV2 cases have been reported in Ethiopia in 2019, with four linked to the outbreak in neighbouring Somalia and the fifth case is part of a newly reported Ethiopian outbreak this week. Ethiopia: The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported is 35. Three cVDPV2 positive environmental samples were reported in Somalia. Two cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week, with date of onset on 18 June and 29 June 2020. Both affected children live in accessible areas of Banadir region, one in Abdul-Aziz district and the other in Shibis district. These are the first cVDPV2 cases to be reported in Somalia in 2020. Both cases are genetically linked to the existing cVDPV2 outbreak in the country. Somalia - In total, 12 cVDPV2 cases have been reported in 2020. The date of onset of the most recent cVDPV2 case is 30 September 2020. Twenty-five (25) cVDPV2 positive environmental samples have been reported so far in 2020. Somalia - Three cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported; one in Galbeed and two in Banadir. There is a total of 27 cVDPV cases (20 type 2, six type 3 and one coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreak in 2018. Somalia - There are 13 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2020 and 3 cases were reported in 2019. Somalia\u2019s outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) has been successfully stopped, with no international spread. Dr Hamid Jafari, Director of Polio Eradication for WHO\u2019s Eastern Mediterranean Region, declared Somalia\u2019s outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) closed a full 28 months after this strain of polio was last detected in Somalia. Kenya There was one cVDPV2 environmental sample reported in 2020 and one in 2021. Ethiopia Two cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in Oromiya. There are nine cases reported in 2021 so far. The total number of 2020 cases remains at 36.

Somalia One new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV 2) was reported from Salagle District, Middle Juba Region. Date of onset of the most recent cVDPV2 was 12 May, 2021. No new cVDPV2 isolated from ES samples reported this week. Only One cVDPV2 isolate was reported in 2021. Twenty-six (26) cVDPV2 isolates were reported from ES samples in 2020. Date of Sample collection of the last positive sample is 23, May 2021. 328 Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases (133 Female and 195 Male) have been reported in 2021. Ethiopia No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week 19 of 2023 (ending 14 May 2023). There was one case reported in 2022. In addition, ten cases were reported in 2021, 38 in 2020 and 15 in 2019. Kenya Two cases of acute flaccid paralysis from the Hagadera refugee camp in Garissa County, Kenya, have been confirmed as circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). The first case is a 24-month-old male child who had received three doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and developed paralysis on 26 May, with stool samples collected on 1 and 2 June. The second case is a 31-month-old girl vaccinated with three doses of OPV who developed paralysis on 27 May and had stool samples collected on 2 and 3 June. Investigations are ongoing, and control measures are being implemented. Somalia A total of 202 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) were reported in 2023, of whom 86(43%) cases were female and 116(57%) cases were male. Of the 202 AFP cases reported,187 (93%) cases had stool samples collected and analysed in the laboratory while 15 (7%) cases are pending laboratory diagnosis. In 2023 two circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were isolated from AFP cases, compared to five cases isolated in 2022. A circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed in Kenya. Three genetically linked cVDPV2s were isolated from two acute flaccid paralysis cases, and one asymptomatic community contact. Genetic sequencing confirms the isolated cVDPV2s are linked to cVDPV2s currently circulating in Banadir, Somalia. Somalia A total of 377 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) were reported in 2023, of whom 171 (43.5%) cases were female and 206(56.5%) cases were male.

The outbreak started in the urban health district of Antananarivo Renivohitra (in the heart of the capital city, Antanarivo) on 4 October 2018 when three measles cases were confirmed at the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar (IPM) by serology. The disease then spread to other health districts (Tan\u00e0 South, Tan\u00e0 North and Ambohidratrimo) in Analamanga Region (where the capital city is located) and subsequently to other parts of the country. The Ministry of Public Health formally declared the measles outbreak on 26 October 2018. As of 18 November 2018, a total of 3 239 measles cases have been reported, of which 182 were confirmed immunoglobulin M (IgM) positive and 3 057 were epidemiologically linked. No deaths have been reported to date. A total of 23 districts (out of 114) in 12 regions (out of 22) are currently in epidemic phase. The urban health district of Antananarivo-Renivohitra is the most affected, accounting for 84% (2 730) of all reported cases. The other health districts with high numbers of cases are Ambatondratrimo (6%, 200), Antananarivo-Atsimondrano (3%, 91). The remaining health districts have fewer cases. The current measles outbreak has occurred at a time when there is some resurgence of plague in the country, straining the public health response system. The ongoing political election, with the risks of social tensions and conflict, has also downgraded the response to these public health events. The measles outbreak in Madagascar has seen a dramatic increase in incidence cases in the last three weeks. Since our last report on 23 November 2018 (Weekly Bulletin 47), 6 125 additional cases have been reported, of which 89 were laboratory-confirmed (immunoglobulin M (IgM) positive) and 6 036 were epidemiologically linked. Eleven new districts have been affected during the past three weeks. The continuous propagation and the rapid increase in the number of measles cases in Madagascar is concerning. The outbreak is already in highly populated areas, and in a largely non-immune population as indicated by the wide range of the age groups affected. Given the high transmissibility of measles, it can be expected that this outbreak may evolve exponentially. The measles outbreak in Madagascar continues to improve, with the trend showing a marked decline. Since our last report on 28 December 2018 (Weekly Bulletin 52), there have been 2 317 additional measles cases reported, of which 231 were confirmed (immunoglobulin M (IgM) positive) and 87 epidemiologically linked. While the situation is improving, the risk of the outbreak spreading to the few remaining unaffected regions of the country remains.

An aftershock of 6.6 occurred at 01:08 pm local time. The epicenter is located in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea which is rugged and mountainous. Outside the provincial capital Goroka, the area is sparsely populated. The earthquakes triggered dozens of landslides in the Finisterre ranges which lie between 146.08 degrees E, 5.50 S and 147.0 E, 6.2 0 S, along the border between Morobe and Madang provinces. According to geologists, this isolated mountainous area is geologically unstable and frequently affected by earthquakes. In the absence of paved roads, access for delivery of relief supplies is only possible by helicopter. The landslides are between 2,000 and 2,500 feet in length and about half a mile wide. They engulfed houses, blocked rivers and have affected food production by the destruction of family gardens. Indications at this stage are that the death toll reaches at least 50, with rising tendency. According to preliminary government estimates, some 60,000 people may have been affected by the event. The impact of the disaster is aggravated, as the same area has been severely hit by drought. A second major aftershock hit Papua New Guinea on Saturday, 16 October 1993, at 1.06 pm local time, about 35 miles northeast of Goroka. The magnitude was computed at 6.5 on the Richter scale. Preliminary hypocenter: latitude 5.7 degrees south, longitude 145.8 degrees east, depth normal. Additional landslides and floods have increased the extent of damage in Morobe and Madang provinces. Several minor earthquakes of 3 to 4 degrees on the Richter scale occurred following the aftershock of 16 October 1993. Landslides are still continuing in the Eastern Highlands. Highly inflammable gases are emanating out of cracks in the ground in coal mining areas. Another major earthquake occurred in Papua New Guinea about 25 miles (40 km) south of Madang or about 280 miles (450 km) north/northwest of Port Moresby at 8:27 pm local time (10:27 am GMT), 25 October 1993. The magnitude was computed at 7.0 on the Richter scale. Preliminary hypocentre is latitude 5.6 degrees south, longitude 145.9 degrees east, depth normal. According to initial information, further landslides were triggered in the Mutzing district and Menyamya district of Morobe province. The general situation remains relatively unchanged. The Government's Geological Survey Division indicated that there have been earthquakes of magnitude around 5 on the Richter scale almost every day since October 13, with some 2,000 aftershocks being recorded. It is impossible to predict how long the earthquakes and aftershocks will continue. Secondary risks exist due to landslides.

The raging floods resulted in substantial destruction of houses, road networks and destroyed the livelihoods of approximately 896 households (5,381 people) according to the results of the rapid needs assessment (RNA) conducted by the Office of National Security (ONS) in collaboration with other humanitarian actors in disaster management.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Rapid needs assessment (RNA) conducted by the Office of National Security (ONS) in collaboration with other humanitarian actors.\",\n        \"affected_countries\": [\"Sierra Leone\"],\n        \"sources\": [\"IFRC\"],\n        \"language\": \"English\"\n    }\n}", "https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2019-000133-som": "{\n    \"https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2019-000133-som\": {\n        \"disaster_title\": \"Somalia: Floods - Oct 2019\",\n        \"disaster_type\": [\"Flood\"],\n        \"date\": \"2019-10-18\",\n        \"disaster_description\": \"Moderate to heavy rains continued in many parts of Somalia and within the Ethiopian highlands over the last one week. River levels at Belet Weyne (Shabelle) are currently very high and the trend is expected to continue reaching over bank in the coming few days. Along Juba, the river levels are also high. The cumulative rainfall forecast for the coming week is calling for moderate to heavy rains across the country as well as the Ethiopian highlands. The river levels will therefore continue to rise with a high risk of flooding along the entire two channels. Flash floods are expected in built-up and low lying areas of Bay, Bakool and central regions given the forecast. Latest reports received in the evening of 21 October indicate that nearly 40 per cent of Belet Weyne town has been affected by flooding with an estimated 72,000 people having moved to Ceel Jaale highlands and surrounding areas. All villages in the north of Belet Weyne town have been affected and humanitarian partners are yet to establish the number of people displaced in these areas. The situation is further compounded by flooding from an outburst of minor tributaries in Belet Weyne, which has caused damage to farmland in villages such as Hawo Taako. Significant portions of crop land were also flooded in Bardheere in Gedo region, (where the river is already at bank full) and Bualle. Riverine communities have been asked to vacate their homes to higher ground with immediate effect. The rains will continue in the next seven days and river levels will continue to rise, further worsening the flood situation. Riverine and flash flooding has affected populations in middle and lower Juba, Bay, lower and middle Shabelle, and Hiraan states. The number of people affected is expected to be high; an initial 76,000 people have been displaced so far in the worst affected areas. The impact of the rains will have on food security is not yet clear. An estimated 182,000 people have been displaced thus far due to flooding, according to UNHCR-Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN). Farmland, infrastructure and roads have been destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas. As of 5 November, 547,000 people have been impacted of whom 370,000 are displaced. In Belet Weyne district, an estimated 45,500 households (273,000 people) have fled their homes. Farmland, infrastructure, and roads have been destroyed in some of the worst-hit areas in Hirshabelle, Jubaland and South West States. At least 17 deaths have been reported. Humanitarian partners have scaled up flood responses by re-programming available resources, but significant gaps remain even as heavy rains subside in some locations. More than 350,000 people have received assistance out of 570,000 flood-affected people. In Belet Weyne, flood water has receded, allowing 80,000 displaced people in Belet Weyne town (40 per cent of 180,000 displaced town residents) to return home. The rains have inundated 207,000 hectares of land along Shabelle and Juba rivers, raising concerns about food security and livelihood losses. On 23 November, the UN and Government launched a 3-month US$72.5 million Flood Response Plan to mobilise additional resources. Some $25 million has been made available - $11 million from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund, $8 million from CERF and funding from ECHO and DFID, but $47.5 million is still required. The Tropical Storm (TS) initially named SIX that developed in the northern Indian Ocean has now been assigned the name PAWAN after sustaining a speed of more than 39 miles per hour for two days. Heavy rain in the last 5 days has affected northern, central and coastal Somalia. On 7 December, Puntland coast was affected by Tropical Storm PAWAN and 2 people died following floods in Las Qoray (Sanaag Region). Roads connecting the town to the rest of the region have been damaged. In central Somalia, the overflow of the River Shabelle flooded Afgooye district, displacing over 1,500 people. According to the Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Agency (HADMA), some 35,600 people in Puntland have been affected by TC Pawan and the consecutive heavy rains which accompanied the tropical cyclone. River floods and flash floods from excessive rainfall have caused moderate damage to crops, especially in riverine livelihood zones. In urban Beletweyne, where floods have disrupted livelihoods and caused large population displacement, significant humanitarian assistance is currently preventing targeted households to meet minimally adequate food consumption requirements.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Humanitarian partners have scaled up flood responses by re-programming available resources.

Following heavy rainfall and strong winds in the capital of China, more than 30,000 people have been displaced as well as another 20,000 in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province. In the Philippines, the passage of DOKSURI on 25-26 July resulted in at least 25 fatalities, 20 missing people, 52 injured, almost 313,000 displaced and a total of approximately 2,400,000 affected people. In China, according to media, as of 2 August, at least 20 people have died, including 11 in Beijing and nine in Hebei Province, while 27 are still missing due to floods and heavy rainfall. More than 50,000 people have been evacuated from the capital and 42,000 people from Shanxi Province, and approximately 125,000 people have been moved to shelters in Zhuozhou City (Hebei Province). In addition, more than 150,000 people were reported to be without running water and nearly 60,000 were affected by power outages. According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC), 675,357 families, equivalent to 2,476,907 persons, have been directly impacted. Among the affected population, 15,566 families constituting 57,281 individuals sought refuge within 763 evacuation centres, while 62,825 families compromising 260,694 persons were served outside the evacuation centres.

In response, the Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization, and other partners are taking steps to manage the outbreak. In a press conference in Juba, Health Minister Honorable Yolanda Awel Deng assured citizens that the government is committed to stopping the spread of cholera in Renk, Upper Nile State. \u201cThe Ministry of Health is aware of the difficult conditions refugees and returnees face, such as overcrowding and poor water and sanitation, which can lead to outbreaks; however, the Ministry is working with health and water sanitation and hygiene cluster partners on the ground to ensure that the risk of the outbreak spreading is minimized,\u201d said Hon.

It is currently moving in a south south easterly direction at a rate of 14km/h, with maximum sustained winds close to the centre estimated at 175km/h. Predictions indicate that TC Harold will increase to a category 5 tropical cyclone within the next 12 hours, then weaken to a category 4 tropical cyclone once it has passed over Vanuatu late on Monday evening. Severe weather warning for heavy rainfalls and flash flooding, including possible landslides are expected... The system will slowly move East/Southeast across central islands by Monday or Tuesday next week and expected near west of Fiji by Wednesday 8 April. Tropical Cyclone HAROLD continued moving south-east over the Coral Sea and made landfall over southwest coast of Espiritu Santo Island (north Vanuatu) on 6 April around 0.00 UTC, with maximum sustained winds up to 215 km/h. Media reported, as of 06 April, 7 fatalities and 21 people were still missing across Salomon Islands. In addition, media reported, hundreds of people preventively evacuated across Espiritu Santo. The northern provinces of Sanma, Malampa and Penama are most affected. Due to its path across the centre of Vanuatu, TC Harold has directly impacted on a large number of populated islands and the large island of Santo with the country\u2019s second largest city Luganville. According to the latest satellite analysis based on the cyclone track and wind speed zones and the population data, at least 112,000 people would be potentially exposed to the strong winds greater than 120km/h. Mobile phone networks on the islands were still down as of 7 April. Two Aerial Surveillance Assessment team were deployed on 7 April to assess the northern provinces and a Rapid Technical Assessment Team is scheduled to be deployed on the ground as soon as conditions allow. In the night of 7-8 April TC Harold headed to Fiji where it hit Viti Levu and the islands to the east as a Category 4 cyclone. The cyclone has caused significant power outages, blocked roads due to fallen trees, and widespread flooding. A total of 69 evacuation centers in four divisions have been set up to accommodated 1,778 evacuees. As of 08 of April the Vanuatu\u2019s National Disaster Management Office estimates that up to 160,000 people may have been affected by the cyclone in the country. The provinces of Sanma (53,344 people), Penama (32,055 people), and Malampa (40,917 people) have been categorized as Priority 1 for assistance. The provinces of Torba (10,102 people) and Shepherds Group (23,056 people) have been categorized as Priority 2. On 9 April, Vanuatu Government issued a request for in-kind assistance to the European Union. In response, as part of the European Union's Civil Protection Mechanism, France is sending tents, shelter kits, kitchen sets and jerry cans. The EU's Copernicus emergency mapping service was activated (EMSR 434) on 6 April, in order to support damage assessment and impact assessment in Vanuatu. In Tonga, significant damage to the water supply and food crops was reported across Tongatapu. Central and Western Tongatapu are expected to be hardest hit due to the king tides and significant flooding. Destruction is widespread, including significant damage to homes, water supply and food crops is reported in 'Eua. Hundreds are reported to be currently sheltering in evacuation centres due to homes being destroyed. In Fiji, telecommunication and electricity networks have been largely restored. Disaster assessments are under way by the national disaster management office. The humanitarian response to Cyclone Harold continues and assessments are ongoing in the most affected areas of Vanuatu, Fiji, and Tonga. Initial findings from an assessment in Sanma Province in Vanuatu indicate that an estimated 80 \u2013 90% of the population lost their houses, while some 60% of schools and 20% of health centres may be damaged. Food crops are seriously damaged. In Fiji, the Government made a Declaration of Natural Disaster for TC Harold on 12 April. As of 13 April, more than 1,800 evacuees are being sheltered in 65 evacuation centres in Fiji, while in Tonga, 17 evacuation centres are sheltering 323 people and an estimated 428 houses have been damaged. UN agencies and NGO partners are supporting the National Disaster Management Authorities and are releasing prepositioned relief items for the response with additional in-kind and logistical support from the FRANZ alliance. On 13 April, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund released USD$ 2.5 million for the response in Vanuatu. In Vanuatu, an estimated 160,000 people have been affected by Tropical Cyclone Harold which hit the island state on 6 April. The provinces of Sanma, Malampa and Penama were hardest hit. Assessments are ongoing by Government and humanitarian partners, including the UN, and the Pacific Humanitarian Team is supporting government-led efforts to respond to needs. Logistics in the response have been hampered by difficult local conditions following the cyclone as well as by COVID-19 restrictions that have been put in place for incoming cargo and people. In Fiji, the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) \u2013 with the help of the Fiji Red Cross, UNICEF and other humanitarian partners on the ground, continues to deliver relief items to some 20,000 people who were most affected by TC Harold in the Eastern Division of the country. Evacuation centres in the north and west have closed, but over 1,300 people remain in 105 centers in the Central (13) and Eastern (92) Divisions. As of 21 April, 1,310 people are sheltering in 105 evacuation centres in the Eastern and Central divisions. The eastern division has the highest number of people in evacuation centres with 1,116 evacuees in 92 evacuation centres. All evacuation centres in Northern and Western Divisions are now closed. In Tonga, most people have returned to their homes from evacuation centers and small-scale relief distributions are ongoing through the National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) and the Tongan Red Cross. In Vanuatu, the NDMO \u2013 together with various ministries and humanitarian partners on the ground - continues to conduct assessments in the three worst-affected provinces of Sanma, Penama and Malampa. Affected populations (up to 160,000 people) particularly need shelter, access to safe water, and food assistance. The health situation, compounded by COVID-19, is also of concern as a number of health structures have been damaged. A total of 15 Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) have been deployed across the three most affected provinces to provide basic health care and \u2013 together with the Food and Nutrition Cluster \u2013 to assess the nutrition situation and distribute nutrition supplements. There has been an increase in response activity with more shelter relief items now being distributed. Concerns remain that this is still very slow and of the estimated 17,347 households in destroyed & severely damaged categories only around 1,954 households have received emergency shelter assistance. This means that only around 11% of houses in the higher damage categories have received emergency shelter assistance. There is currently enough stock in-country to cover 36% of emergency shelter needs. The Vanuatu Shelter Cluster now estimates that there is enough available to address humanitarian shelter needs of approximately 82 per cent of households whose homes have been severely damaged or destroyed. However, only 13% of households in need have received shelter assistance so far. As of 6 May, there are 610 people in 79 evacuation centers in Fiji. According to the Agriculture final assessment report at least 53,000 farmers have been affected by TC Harold, with the cost of damage to crops and livestock estimated to be FJD29 million. In Toga, UNICEF has supported MIA to provide psychosocial support (PSS) and counseling for 300 children and 840 community members in Siesia island and Patangata village, Tongatapu; PSS/counseling for 1200 children delivered through most affected schools in Hihifo and Kolofo\u2019ou districts, Tongatapu; PSS support to 45 families in Eua island. In Solomon Islands initial assessment show 25 schools in three provinces - Guadalcanal, Makira Ulawa, Central Islands \u2013 have been damaged or destroyed. Damage has been reported to classrooms, specialized classrooms, WASH infrastructures and staff houses, as well as learning/teaching resources. In Vanuatu, at least 60 percent of croplands have been severely damaged by the cyclone according to early estimates by FAO. Based on the Rapid Technical Assessment report of the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), food crops as well as export crops have been uprooted and snapped at the trunk by the strong winds. At household level, severe losses of stored crops and seeds as well as small livestock were reported. International food aid and agricultural assistance, in the form of vegetable seeds, planting material and farming equipment, are urgently needed to facilitate crop replanting and to prevent the deterioration of the food security situation. FAO is working with the Vanuatu Food Security and Agriculture Cluster and the NDMO to restore agricultural production and rebuild people's livelihoods. Humanitarian programmes continue to respond to the needs of people affected by Cyclone Harold. In Fiji, damage to crops and livestock is reported to be approximately FJD29 million and as of 10th May, a total of 610 people remain in 79 evacuation centres in the Central (8) and Eastern (71) Divisions respectively. Humanitarian response is continuing with emphasis on WASH, Food Security, Shelter and Health. In Vanuatu, the National Disaster Management Office has organized 12 shipments of food and non-food items (tents, tarpaulins, medical supplies, fuel) to affected areas since 10 April and a Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) of USD2.58 million was approved for live-saving activities to assist 109,000 people in need. In Fiji, a total of 610 people are still hosted in 79 evacuation centers in the Central (8) and Eastern (71) Divisions respectively after being displaced by Tropical Cyclone Harold over one month ago. The humanitarian response is ongoing, and is focusing on water and sanitation, food security, shelter, and health response activities. An allocation from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has been approved with US$1M to provide assistance to 200,000 people in need.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"The Vanuatu Government issued a request for in-kind assistance to the European Union.

Many schools were inundated and damaged. 12,000 ha of rice and 12,000 ha of other crops flooded and damaged. At Le Thuy and Quang Ninh districts (Quang Binh province), 80 percent of the area was submerged. Trung Son village in Quang Ninh district was heavily hit with most people losing all their property. The heavy torrential rains which hit six central provinces (Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thue Thien Hue and Quang Nam-Da Nang) during the period 5 to 9 October 1992 left many people in need of emergency assistance, washed away houses, devastated crops and caused widespread damage. Updated assessment of disaster impact as follows: death toll: 55, injured: 10, homeless: 7,579, people in need of urgent relief assistance: 44,109, houses submerged: 35,000, houses drifted away or damaged: 146,730, schools/classrooms collapsed/washed away or damaged: 487, hospitals/dispensaries submerged/damaged: 155. Torrential rains during four days (28 to 31 October 1992) again caused flooding in Quang Binh and Quang Tri, the two provinces which had been most seriously affected by the recent floods. In Quang Binh province, the average rainfall was about 400 mm. According to initial reports, one person died, 11 out of 14 villages in Quang Ninh district were again submerged, with 12,000 families (58,000 persons) being affected. In Le Thuy district, flood waters reached 1.5 to 2 meters and submerged 12 out of 27 villages. The highest rainfall was recorded in Truong Son community (616 mm), where nearly 3,000 people were displaced who had already become homeless during the previous floods. In Quang Tri province, many places were reported to be between 2.5 and 3 meters under water. The most affected districts are Cua Lo, Vinh Linh and Gio Linh where communications failed completely. Preliminary reports indicate: one person dead, 30 houses washed away, 80,000 houses inundated, 300,000 cubic meters of dykes washed away, hundreds of bridges and sluices washed away, about 1,000 ha of rice, manioc and other crops destroyed or, badly damaged.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"The heavy torrential rains which hit six central provinces during the period 5 to 9 October 1992 left many people in need of emergency assistance.

The affected families have lost the entire structure of their homes but also basic subsistence items and animals. Since the first week of February, strong winds and high temperatures fuelled by heat wave have sparked dozens of wildfires across central Chile. A state of emergency has been declared in Araucan\u00eda, Biob\u00edo and \u00d1uble, the most affected areas. According to Chile's disaster mitigation agency, some 286,299 ha have been burned until now by the fires. At least 23 people have died in connection to the fires, while 979 have been reported injured. Hundreds of homes have reportedly been damaged or destroyed and more than 1,500 people have sought refuge in shelters.

The flood-affected population has received food, water, and other assistance from the de facto authorities and partners. On 5 July, partners conducted a rapid needs assessment at 26 sites. Amid the ongoing conflict in many parts of the country, Myanmar continues to grapple with flooding during the monsoon season. Since the end of June, low-lying areas along various rivers, especially Ayeyarwady and Chindwin, have been affected. In the northwest, more than 15 townships in Magway, Mandalay and Sagaing have been affected, with an estimated 118,000 people being temporarily evacuated to safer places since the beginning of July. Sagaing has been the hardest hit, with at least 11 townships flooded, followed by Mandalay, which had four townships affected. In Kachin, approximately 37,000 people in several townships were also temporarily evacuated due to the flash flooding on 30 June. Most of the flood-affected population in Myitkyina and Waingmaw townships have returned home as water levels have receded. Immediate lifesaving assistance was provided by humanitarian partners and local authorities in Kachin and in the northwest. In Myanmar, the monsoon season has brought prolonged heavy rainfall which caused flooding over Kachin, Kayin, Sagaing, Tanintharyi, Bago, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Yangon and Ayeyarwady. According to reports from DDM as of 4 August, approximately 230,000 persons or 56,000 households affected. As of reporting, more than 120,000 persons are still displaced in 445 temporary evacuation places in 46 townships from 10 regions/states. An estimated 196,750 USD worth of assistance has been provided to the affected community from Myanmar Authorities. According to DDM Myanmar as of 6 August, a total of 59,000 families (240,000 individuals) affected over Kachin, Kayin, Sagaing, Tanintharyi, Bago, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Yangon and Ayeyarwady. According to the report, 2 persons have been reportedly dead (1 from Kayin and 1 from Sagaing). As of 6 August, over 28,000 families (110,000 individuals) still displaced in 399 temporary evacuation centres and in their relative homes over 36 townships from Kayin, Tanintharyi, Bago, Mon, Yangon and Ayeyarwady. Due to ongoing monsoon rains, widespread flooding continues to be reported at different locations along the main rivers, affecting the Ayeyarwady delta, Rakhine, Mon, Tanintharyi coastal areas, and regions including Yangon and Bago. This situation is exacerbated by Typhoon Gaemi, which struck Taiwan with wind speeds of 127 mph on 25 July. The residual clouds from the typhoon moved towards Myanmar, Thailand, and China, potentially generating further flooding and heavy rainfall in these regions. Since the end of June, torrential monsoon rains and overflow of various rivers have submerged several states and regions from the north to the south of the country. Flooding temporarily affected Kachin State in early July and Magway, Mandalay and Sagaing regions across the Northwest around mid-July. Several townships in Rakhine State have been submerged since the last week of July, although the water level has been receding. Since 25 July, there has been widespread flooding in southeastern Myanmar, with multiple townships being inundated in the states and regions of Bago, Kayah, Kayin, Mon and Tanintharyi. Countrywide, it is estimated that the flooding has affected more than 393,000 people, resulting in the temporary displacement of many families, damages to and disruption of roads, railways and the movement of goods, destruction of paddy fields and livelihoods, and closure of schools. DG ECHO has replenished the Disaster Response Emergency Fund (IFRC-DREF) of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) with \u20ac 200,000 to support victims of heavy flooding in Myanmar, which has affected more than 100,000 people. The allocation will help the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) scale up ongoing humanitarian assistance for communities in the most affected areas: Ayeyarwady and Bago region (East and West), Kayin and Mon states, Tanintharyi and Yangon regions. The primary focus of this allocation will be essential household items, cash for immediate necessities, first aid and health support including hygiene items and hygiene promotion to prevent waterborne diseases for 15,000 people in urgent need of assistance. This includes families whose houses were damaged or destroyed, single-parent households with children under five, older persons, and people with disabilities. Since 9 September, heavy rains caused by the monsoon season and remnants of Typhoon Yagi have led to severe flooding across Myanmar. Central Myanmar is currently the hardest hit. The flood impacted 59 townships in nine regions and states, including the state\u2019s capital, Nay Pyi Taw, Bago, Kayah, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, and eastern and southern Shan. There has been significant damage to road networks, transportation, telecommunications, and electricity in affected areas. Most areas remain flooded, although some townships have started to see receding water levels. While data verification is challenging, an estimated 631,000 people might have been affected by flooding across the country. Ten days after the extensive flash flooding, emerging reports of impact indicate that an estimated 887,000 people, including displaced people, have been affected in 65 townships across Bago, Kayah, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Nay Pyi Taw, Rakhine, Sagaing and eastern and southern Shan regions/states. So far, more than 300 fatalities and nearly 100 injuries have been reported. The most severely affected areas remain in devastation, with widespread destruction to homes, household assets, water sources, and electricity infrastructure. Roads, bridges, communication networks, schools, public service facilities, religious sites, and crops and farmlands have been severely damaged or completely collapsed. As of 26 September, an estimated 1 million people across 70 out of the 330 townships in Myanmar are reportedly affected by the flooding from heavy monsoon rains and remnants of Typhoon Yagi. This widespread flooding has caused significant damage in the Northwest, Southeast, and Rakhine State. More than 360 people have reportedly drowned, with at least 100 more missing due to the severe flooding. The floods have caused widespread devastation, submerging thousands of crops, farmlands, and livestock, leading to substantial losses in the livelihoods of affected communities. About 300,000 children have been directly affected by the floods, with many schools closed, damaged, or being used as temporary shelters, exacerbating the hardships faced by children already enduring the brunt of ongoing conflict. Homes, household assets and critical infrastructure including health facilities, schools, water and sanitation services, major highways and bridges have been significantly damaged. Many families have been forced to evacuate as livelihoods have also been destroyed. Communication challenges continue due to the flooded roads and destroyed electric lines. Although there has been a decrease in floodwaters in some areas, recurring flooding and potential river overflows continue to be a threat due to the ongoing rain and riverine conditions. Across all affected areas, critical needs include access to safe drinking water, hygiene items, medicine, food, shelter, and humanitarian cash assistance.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"The flood-affected population has received food, water, and other assistance from the de facto authorities and partners.

The EAP for dzud covers 21 provinces. It will be implemented by the Mongolian Red Cross Society (MRCS), with technical support from Climate Centre. Early action has the capacity to reach up to 1,000 households or approximately 4,000 people throughout the country. The dzud risk map, which guides aid distribution, is typically published in November (when a solid snow cover is formed) by the National Agency for Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring (NAMEM). 11 different parameters outline risk factors for dzud, including summer conditions, pasture carrying capacity, number of grazers, biomass/1,500 site, anomalous precipitation, anomalous temperature, drought index, snow depth, snow cover, air temperature forecast and precipitation forecast. On 2 January, Mongolia's National Agency for Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring announced more than 50 per cent of the country was at risk of an extreme (dzud) winter. This unwelcome news has triggered the pre-agreed release of CHF 210,968 (217,000 US dollars) to the Mongolian Red Cross Society for forecast-based action from IFRC's Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF). The funding provides 88 Swiss francs (90.6 US dollars) cash each for 1,000 vulnerable herder families to prevent the starvation, dehydration and cold exposure of their livestock because of poor access to feed, water, veterinary care and shelter. A livestock nutrition kit will support livestock health during winter's lean months. As stated by National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and National Agency for Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring (NAMEM) on 12 January, over 70 percent of the country is covered by 10-30cm thick layer of snow. The joint assessment team of NEMA and MOFALI have reported that the Arkhangai, Bulgan, Govi-Altai, Dundgovi, Uvurkhangai, Sukhbaatar, Khovd, Khentii and Zavkhan provinces are experiencing severe winter as the local hay and fodder reserves have been completely consumed at soum level. Recognising their vulnerability, the Government of Mongolia allocated funding of 1.7 billion tugriks to provinces with a higher risk of being affected by dzud in December 2019. Among the recipients, 50 million tugriks have been allocated to the Uvurkhangai, Arkhangai, Dundogovi, Tuv, Bulgan, Zavkhan, Khuvsgul provinces, where most herders migrate or go on otor, and 40.3 million tugriks worth of medical and nutritional items have been allocated for the Uvurkhangai, Dundgovi, Tuv, Zavkhan and Khuvsgul provinces. UNICEF Mongolia is also piloting a cash transfer program for children aged 0-5 years living in various soums in the Zavkhan province. The Mongolian National Agency for Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring (NAMEM) has developed an extreme winter (dzud) risk map for the country using MODIS satellite data, among other resources. The map indicates that over 50 per cent of the territory is identified with severe winter risk, while 25 per cent of the area is in mid-risk. Eight provinces have over 20 per cent of very high-risk coverage in the territory. The Mongolian dzud has severe impacts on the agricultural sector which, because of the harsh weather, remains heavily focused on nomadic animal husbandry that directly supports about a quarter of people and is the only source of income for herders. Continuous harsh conditions put at risk millions of livestock, which are the only source of food, transport and income for almost half the population of Mongolia, leaving thousands of families in hardship and forcing them to move to rural areas or outside the country.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"The IFRC released an Early Action Protocol (EAP) to guide assistance efforts, implemented by the Mongolian Red Cross Society with technical support from Climate Centre.

The pest has been recently detected in Kenya and is suspected to have entered the country from Uganda. It is also known to be present in Burundi, Ethiopia and Rwanda. The fall armyworm was first reported in western Kenya by farmers in March 2017, and immediately confirmed by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service and Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation. The initial counties infested were Busia, TransNzoia, Bungoma, Uasin Gishu and Nandi. As of 23 May, Fall Armyworm has affected more than 143,000 hectares of land in major maize and wheat-producing counties in Kenya. The fall armyworm, which first arrived in Africa in 2016, was intercepted on a few hectares of irrigated maize fields in southern Ethiopia in the last week of February 2017. It has now covered about 52,962 hectares in 144 districts in three of the major maize-growing regional states \u2013 Gambella, Oromia and Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples\u2019 Region (SNNPR). Fall armyworm, which has caused extensive damage to maize crops in southern Africa, has spread to the east and has worsened the situation. In Kenya, the pest has so far affected about 200,000 hectares of crops, and in Uganda more than half the country's 111 districts are affected. An outbreak of fall armyworm was reported by the Government of South Sudan in the Equatoria region including Magwi, Yei and Juba, Northern Bahr el Gazal and parts of Jonglei area. Despite containment efforts, fall armyworm (FAW) - an insect native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas\u2014is expected to remain a threat to food insecurity in the Horn of Africa in 2018. In Uganda, Fall Army Worm incidence during the 2019 first season is expected at levels comparable to the 2018 first season. However, the limited tendency of FAW to spread amidst above-average rainfall, coupled with some prevention efforts by the local government and farmers, could result in a significant decrease in levels of infestation and damage. FAW infestation continues to threaten food security to small holder farmers in Ethiopia. The effects of the fall armyworm (FAW) in Kenya were ultimately minimal, given that farmers\u2019 use of integrated pest management combined with heavy rainfall from April onward. There is currently an infestation of the FAW in Ethiopia's East Wollega of Oromia region, and the North Shewa zone of Amhara region. Around 1,250 hectares of maize has been affected, and there is a risk it will continue to spread. The impact of the FAW on crops in conjunction with destruction caused by desert locusts will likely negatively impact agricultural production and heighten pre-existing food insecurity. In 2018, Ethiopia's Ministry of Agriculture and the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that the FAW caused an estimated 35% reduction in crop yields in Meher seasonal production, affecting more than 150,000 out of 770,000 hectares infested across the country. An outbreak of Fall Armyworm was recently signaled in Burundi, but, significant impacts on crop production are not expected due to the availability of pesticides and improved knowledge of control practices among farmers.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture in Kenya have adopted a planning response figure of 800,000 hectares, which requires US$33.5 million for pesticides and awareness campaigns in the medium term.

Taking into account the speed at which the worms spread, it is highly likely that other neighbouring provinces, especially Nord-Kivu, Ituri, Maniema and Kasai, are already affected. The extent of the spread would result in a significant impact on the local corn production. As of August 2017, the spread of fall armyworms has destroyed crops in 50 out of the country\u2019s 145 territories. Between 50 to 80 percent of people in some of the areas affected by hunger struggle to make ends meet and to have something to eat. The number of acutely food insecure people from June to December 2017 has risen by almost 2 million since the same period in 2016. Conflict is causing widespread insecurity and population displacements in North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, Haut-Katanga and Kasai provinces. As of October 2017, 3.9 million people were internally displaced, more than 1.3 million in Kasai. Many people are eating little more than a meal a day \u2013 typically just maize or cassava root and leaves. Crops have been destroyed, production areas and market routes cut off, huge numbers of farmers displaced and planting areas severely reduced. Crop production has been affected by pest attacks such as the Fall Armyworm, which has affected more than 80 territories. The depreciation of the local currency has resulted in more expensive and reduced imports. This, combined with limited domestic food supplies, has pushed up cereal prices. Conflict related reduction in area planted as well as destruction from the Fall Army Worm (FAW) infestation are expected to contribute towards below average 2017 crop. Both factors will likely remain relevant through the early part of 2018 and consequently result in weak expectations for 2018 harvests. In Ghana, armyworms have ravaged around 1.4 million hectares of maize and cowpea plantations in six regions (Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Central, Western, Eastern and the Northern). In Ashanti, some 6,400 hectares of cocoa farms have also been affected. Although the infestations occur every year, experts say that this year\u2019s outbreak is unprecedented and have urged quick action to curb further destruction as food security and livelihoods of several households is threatened. In Cameroon, as of late August, the Ministry of Agriculture informed that the fall armyworm pest had infested 6 of the central African state\u2019s 10 regions. Armyworms have been a serious threat to food security in the country because cereals like maize, sorghum, rice and legume plants like cow-pea, peanuts and beans are increasingly being attacked every day. In Nigeria, on 5 September, FAO and the Government signed a Technical Cooperation Agreement to curtail Fall Armyworm infestation, as Minister of Agriculture appealed for enhanced FAO support to manage crop diseases in Nigeria. The objective of the TCP includes the establishment of capacities to detect, monitor and control the FAW infestation in maize production. The project is expected to improve national capacities for Fall Armyworm surveillance and monitoring in affected areas, the establishment of Public Awareness on FAW, strengthen national capacities for FAW management, restore productive capacity and enhance livelihood in the worst affected households. FAO has conducted a sub-regional FAW ToT in Abuja, Nigeria on 5 - 10 September 2017 to increase the skills and knowledge of national plant protection and extension experts and FFS practitioners (Master trainers and facilitators) on FAW in Western Africa. The trained will in turn train other staff and farmers on management of the pest in their respective countries. Topics covered were FAW identification and diagnosis, scouting, early warning systems, contingency planning, impact assessments and integrated management options for the pest. Despite the damage caused by the floods and the impact of Fall Armyworm infestations in localized areas, the aggregate cereal harvest in West Africa is expected to set another record, slightly above the 2016 output and about 9 percent above the average of the previous five years. As of 31 October 2017, the fall armyworm situation (Spodoptera frugiperda) is still worrying. Except for Mauritania, Liberia and Sierra Leone, it has been detected in all West Africa and Sahel countries. In Cabo Verde, a major and widespread attack of Fall Armyworms was reported at the national level, but had a particularly severe impact in on Santiago, Fogo and Santo Ant\u00e3o regions. The Fall Armyworm attacks have affected maize crops in Santiago and Fogo, the two islands that together account for about 85 percent of the maize production.

The earthquake \u2013 which was recorded at a depth of 10 km \u2013 was reportedly felt in neighbouring provinces including Kabul, as well as in Islamabad, Pakistan and India. Affected districts identified to date include Barmal, Ziruk, Nika and Giyan in Paktika province and Spera district in Khost Province. Gayan district in Paktika province is reportedly the worst affected with up to 200 people killed and 100 people injured, many of them seriously. The number of people killed or injured has yet to be confirmed. In addition, up to 1,800 homes have reportedly been destroyed and damaged in Gayan, representing 70 per cent of the district\u2019s housing stock. In Spera district, Khost province, 25 people have reportedly been killed and 20 injured. A massive earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale hit the three eastern provinces of Paktika, Paktia and Khost last night. So far, around 920 casualties have been reported. \\\"This number will definitely increase, as the region is very mountainous and difficult to access,\\\" says Naeem Shah, Johanniter Head of Mission in Afghanistan. Johanniter, together with its partner HADAAF, has been providing medical assistance to the residents of Khost province and the Pakistani refugees living there in Gulan Camp. HADAAF has already sent assessment teams to the affected areas in Khost. After the 5.9 M earthquake that occurred in the Spera District (Khost Province, eastern Afghanistan) close to the border with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (north-western Pakistan), the number of casualties has increased. The most affected Provinces are Paktika, Khost, and Nangarhar. Needs assessment continues today and tomorrow. The most important immediate needs are in the sectors of food, health/trauma, and basic non-food items and emergency shelter. In Pakistan, one person died, and two houses have been damaged in Lakki Marwat District (southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), following the seismic event. To date, around 770 people are estimated to have been killed across Barmal (500) and Giyan (238) districts in Paktika province, and Spera district (29) in Khost province. In addition, at least 1,455 people have been injured across three of the six most affected districts of Barmal, (1,000), Giyan (393), and Spera (62) \u2013 many of them seriously. Further, nearly 1,500 homes have now been verified as destroyed and damaged in Giyan district, Paktika province. On the evening of 22 June, the Ministry of Defense confirmed that 90 per cent of search and rescue operations had been finalized. Additional assessments are taking place today to verify this, however, and casualties may rise further. On 24 June, Pakistan\u2019s Meteorological Department recorded a 4.2 magnitude aftershock in Giyan District, Paktika province \u2013 one of the worst-affected districts following Wednesday\u2019s 5.9 magnitude earthquake. Local media reports that the aftershock killed five people and injured a further 11 have yet to be verified. Currently, the death toll from Wednesday\u2019s earthquake stands at around 770 people killed and nearly 1,500 wounded. Latest findings from needs assessments reveal that at least 155 children were killed and nearly 250 children were injured by the earthquake, with 86 per cent losing their lives in Giyan district (134), Paktika province alone. Additionally, 65 children have reportedly been orphaned or left unaccompanied as a result of the tremor. Findings from assessments further highlight that almost 1,900 homes across Giyan (1,028) and Barmal (450) districts in Paktika province, and Spera (416) district in Khost province have been destroyed. Many more are estimated to have experienced extensive damage and are at-risk of collapse. Shelter assessments to ascertain the full extent of damage are continuing. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), after the 5.9 M earthquake occurred on 21 June in Spera District (Khost Province, eastern Afghanistan), 1,039 people have died, 2,949 people have been injured and 4,500 houses have been partially or fully damaged across Paktika and Khost Provinces. The most affected Districts are Giyan, Barmal, and Ziruk Districts in Paktika Province, and Spera in Khost Province. On 24 June, an aftershock of 4.3 M hit the affected area, and at least five persons died while 11 others were injured. Needs assessments are being completed, the final numbers of death and affected are being confirmed. Humanitarian assistance in Paktika and Khost Provinces is continuing. On 27 June, the Humanitarian Coordinator launched an emergency appeal calling for $110 million to urgently help 362,000 men, women and children for the next three months in the hardest-hit areas in the provinces of Paktika and Khost. This new appeal is part of this year\u2019s Humanitarian Response Plan, which calls for $4.4 billion, but is massively underfunded at just over one third. The UN and humanitarian partners are borrowing stocks, personnel, and resources from existing humanitarian programmes, which will have immediate impact if these stocks are not replenished (particularly food stocks and WASH supplies). Humanitarian partners continue to mobilize and scale-up their capacity and presence to respond to earthquake-related needs across Khost and Paktika provinces. Assessments reveal that women and girls comprise the majority of those affected (51 per cent) and that at least 10,331 homes (93 per cent of those assessed) were damaged (fully or partially) in Paktika and Khost provinces with many more are at risk of collapse; while 71 per cent of the assessed villages reported severe or complete loss of their grain facilities; 36 per cent of the assessed villages have either severely or completely damaged school buildings, 18 per cent of villages reported damaged clinics, and 60 per cent of water points are reportedly damaged. The fragile living conditions in the affected communities and high temperature in summer have increased the risk of communicable diseases, such as acute watery diarrhea (AWD)/cholera, and malaria. More than 464 cases of AWD were confirmed in Giyan, Barmal and Spera between 3 and 10 July. An earthquake of 5.1 M at a depth of 10 km occurred in eastern Afghanistan, near the border with north-western Pakistan, on 18 July at 12:22 UTC (16:52 local time). The epicentre was located in the Spera district (Khost province), approximately 10 km south-west of Spera town. Media report, as of 20 July, 44 injured people and around 600 destroyed houses across the Spera district and the neighbouring Giya district (Paktika province). On 21 June 2022, the same area has been affected by a 5.9 M earthquake that resulted in more than 1,000 fatalities. To date, around 376,000 people have been reached with at least one form of assistance, including 124,000 with food and agricultural support; 93,000 with emergency shelter and non-food Items (NFIs); 66,000 with protection; and 90,000 with multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA). A further 313,000 people have received blanket WASH assistance \u2013 soap and chlorine tabs \u2013 as part of preemptive measures to prevent the spread of acute watery diarrhea (AWD); 152,000 health consultations have also been provided. Overall, humanitarian partners reached more than 515,000 people with at least one form of humanitarian assistance. Around 1.2 million people have received water treatment products (i.e. chlorine tabs), soap, hygiene promotion messages and awareness session as part of measures to prevent the spread of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD). The Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) classified the earthquake-affected provinces as phase 3 (crisis) & 4 (emergency) where around half of the population are estimated to be food insecure; about 112,000 people have been assisted with emergency food assistance. More than 20 health partners are active in all the earthquake-affected areas and have reached 203,000 people through mobile and fixed health teams. More than 75,000 children and caregivers have been reached with primary and life-saving protection intervention and over 9,000 women and girls received life-saving information and services on women's protection and health. Besides the earthquake, the affected areas have been historically underserved with around 30,000 school aged children in need of education. UNICEF has established 140 Community-Based Education (CBE) and assessed 17 schools and one Madrassa for renovation.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Johanniter, together with its partner HADAAF, has been providing medical assistance to the residents of Khost province and the Pakistani refugees living there in Gulan Camp.

Since 7th of August 2018, Mali has been affected by heavy rainfall, which peaked between 17 to 19 August, causing floods across the country. These floods have caused great damage in localities of six out of the ten regions of the country. In addition, according to the Climate Prediction Center\u2019s Africa Hazards Outlook, during the third week of August, heavy rainfall accumulations (>100mm) were received throughout several West African nations including Mali, after several previous weeks of heavy and above-average rainfall. The situation, which in this current post-election period is currently affected by various types of crises (food insecurity, conflicts etc.), is likely to sustain further flooding problems in Mali and will only exacerbate the already enormous humanitarian needs in the coming months. According to data collected by the Directorate General of Civil Protection (DGPC), floods affected more than 137,000 people and caused 13 deaths on 17 September. The hydrological and meteorological forecasts have indicated normal to excess rainfall with an average rise of two centimetres per day for both the Niger and Senegal rivers. This situation deserves a special attention as the number of people affected has reached its highest level in the last six years. The population at risk of flooding in the country is estimated at more than 183,000 people. The floods partially or totally destroyed approximately 6,350 houses and 92 water wells.

On the 22nd of October, Tropical Cyclone LOLA made landfall in Solomon Islands, first striking Tikopia Island as a Category 3 cyclone, before increasing in intensity on its way to Vanuatu. Based on the exposure analysis, the population exposed was approx. 22,319 people (4,699 households) with about 1,000 people living in the red zone (>120km/hr winds). Initial reports indicate that more than 100 houses and kitchens were destroyed, and water sources damaged. Four people sustained injuries. On 23 October at 5.00 UTC its centre was located over the Ocean approximately 230 km north-east of the Vanua Lava Island (Torba Province, northern Vanuatu) and 385 km north-east of Luganville City (Espiritu Santo Island, Sanma Province, central Vanuatu), with maximum sustained winds up to 140 km/h. On the forecast track, LOLA is expected to continue southwestward and to pass between the Espiritu Santo Island and the Malekula Islands in the afternoon (UTC) of 24 October, with maximum sustained winds of 130-145 km/h. After that, it could reach the southern New Caledonia (France) on 27-28 October, as a tropical storm. Severe Tropical Cyclone LOLA (category 3) has moved in a southwest direction and is expected to affect the Islands of Penama, Malampa and Shefa in the next 24 hours. Power and communication networks have been cut, making it difficult to report the impact on those islands at this stage. Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) has activated offices in six provinces, ready to carry out a rapid assessment after the cyclone. 300 evacuation centres with many located in schools and churches were set up throughout Vanuatu. Port Vila, the capital, is on red alert and all government offices, markets, and banks are closed until further notice. Heavy rainfalls with flash flooding are expected over low-lying areas and areas close to river banks, including coastal flooding. Very rough seas with heavy to phenomenal swells are expected over all Vanuatu waters. On 25 October, Vanuatu requested support from the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM), consisting of a surveillance flight, shelter kits, tarpaulins. Tropical cyclone LOLA passed over Malekula Island, Malampa Province, central Vanuatu on very early in the morning (UTC) of 25 October as a tropical cyclone and continued south-west over the Pacific Ocean. 26 October at 0.00 (UTC) its centre was located over the Ocean approximately 350 km north of the north-eastern New Caledonia (France), with maximum sustained winds of 46 km/h (tropical depression). As of 26 October, media report damage to infrastructure, schools, some destroyed houses and a number of blocked roads across Penama and Malampa Provinces. LOLA is forecast to continue southwestward over the Ocean, further weakening and dissipating in the afternoon (UTC) of 26 October, well off the coast of northern New Caledonia. Over the next 48 hours, very heavy rainfall, strong wind and storm surge are forecast over the whole Vanuatu and New Caledonia. Very heavy rainfall, strong winds and storm surges caused by the passage of the tropical cyclone LOLA (with maximum sustained winds up to 222 km/h) on 24-25 October (UTC) over central and northern Vanuatu caused widespread and severe damage. The International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and media report that as of 27 October, approximately 10,000 houses have been damaged and a number of schools and bridges destroyed. There has also been damage to the road network across Penama, Malampa, Sanma and Torba Provinces (central-northern Vanuatu). The Pentecost Island (Penama Province) is the worst affected area. The Government of Vanuatu has declared a State of Emergency for six months for Torba, Sanma, Penama, Malampa and Shefa Provinces. The estimated affected population in these provinces is approximately 110,750 people, with approximately 50,300 people affected in the priority area 1 (approx. 12,000 households); approx. 46,600 in priority area 2; and approx. 14,000 in priority area 3. Tropical cyclone LOLA made landfall on 22 October (UTC) in Solomon Islands. According to OCHA, as of 1 November, more than 22,319 people were affected in Solomon Islands and more than 100 buildings have been destroyed and water sources have been damaged. According to initial data collected by VRCS, over 46,000 households, representing over 180,000 people, were affected by severe winds, intense rainfall and flooding. An estimated 75 per cent of buildings and houses were destroyed in Priority 1 areas and 50 per cent of buildings and houses were destroyed or damaged in Priority 2 areas. VRCS encountered significant challenges getting to the northern province of Penama as well, and particularly northern and eastern Pentecost, due to damaged or blocked roads and in general response efforts at this stage can only be done by large boats. In the immediate aftermath of TC Lola, UNICEF promptly carried out a rapid needs assessment on October 27 in the worst affected provinces of Melampa and Penama. It is estimated that over 28,000 students in these two provinces may face disruptions to their education for the rest of the year, potentially losing over 300 hours of classroom learning. The Education Rapid Assessment findings on November 7 revealed significant damage in 61% of schools in Priority 1 areas, 41% in Priority 2 areas, and 28% in Priority 3 areas. Tropical Cyclone Lola has not only affected Vanuatu but also impacted the Solomon Islands, specifically in the Temotu province. Tikopia and the Duff Islands have suffered significant damage to education infrastructure, with school buildings and dormitories being particularly affected. Communication with remote areas remains challenging due to the damage to solar and telecommunication towers, leading to reduced services in the affected region. Extensive damage to desalination plants and food crops underscores the urgency to prioritise health, nutrition, and WASH supplies, especially in areas where outbreaks of diarrhoea and dysentery have reportedly claimed four lives on the island of Vanikoro.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) activated offices in six provinces for rapid assessment. 300 evacuation centres were set up throughout Vanuatu.

Solukhumbu and Palpa districts were particularly affected by the combined effects of flooding, landslides and heavy monsoon rains. To date, authorities confirmed at least 34 deaths. The Government has provided cash grants to families in Saptari District whose houses were destroyed by the floods. A rapid needs assessment is ongoing in Saptari. Red Cross volunteers and emergency teams are searching for survivors as flash floods and landslides have submerged thousands of homes in several parts of Nepal, mostly in the south of the country. The floods and landslides have claimed at least 53 lives over the past three days, in the Terai region bordering India and other areas of Nepal, according to the Government of Nepal. Dozens more are missing or injured. Monsoon rains and floods in the past two weeks have affected more than 100,000 people. First aid and relief supplies have been provided around the clock by hundreds of volunteers from the Nepal Red Cross Society. Due to continuous rainfall in different parts of the country, approximately 100,000 people in 31 districts have been affected by the floods and landslides in the last two weeks. According to the Nepal Red Cross Initial Rapid Assessment (IRA) reports received from the affected districts as of 13 August 2017, a total of 27,861 families (139,300 people) have been affected, of which 6,247 families (47,350 people) are displaced. Some 2,964 houses are completed destroyed and 8,344 are partially damaged. The report indicates that 64 people are confirmed dead; 16 people are still missing; and 44 people have been injured. The numbers have been increasing day by day; this is likely to continue as some of the affected areas are challenging to access. NRCS has already deployed 448 Red Cross volunteers including District Disaster Response Team (DDRT) members, trained First Aid and National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) members on the ground for immediate response. As of 16 August, 18,320 families are confirmed to have been displaced, and 75,000 families are affected by the flooding. More than 100,000 people have been rescued by formal and informal search and rescue. There have been 123 recorded deaths, according to Nepal's Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA). Water levels in flood-affected areas have been gradually receding as the rainfall has significantly decreased or stopped in most parts of the country. However, the number of affected districts has increased to 35 (out of 75 districts nationwide); Morang, Sunsari, Siraha, Rautahat, Mahottari, Dhanusa, Sindhuli, Bara, Parsa, Dang, Banke and Bardiya are among the worst hit districts. The Ministry of Home Affairs says that more than 80 percent of land in the Tarai has been inundated. Hydro-meteorological stations in Banke, Chitwan and Makwanpur recorded the heaviest rainfall in 60 years. Moderate to heavy rains have been forecast across Nepal for the coming days. Significant access challenges remain: Biratnagar airport remains closed, and other basic services such as transport routes, electric power and drinking water supplies, and communications are reportedly still disrupted. As of 18 August, the districts with the highest numbers of people affected by the floods are: Saptari, Rautahat, Mahottari, Siraha, Baridya, Sunsari, Banke, Chitwan, Morang, Sarlahi, Kailali and Jhapa. Across all affected districts, 44,683 families have been displaced; at least 383 schools and learning centres are being used as temporary shelters. Flood waters are receding; however, with access improving and a better understanding of the impact and damage caused by the floods, the overall number of affected people continues to rise. There are significant concerns about the possibility of disease outbreaks after the floods, with affected people facing difficulties in accessing adequate health care. As of 21 August, Initial Rapid Assessments (IRA) have been completed in 24 districts. A total of 1.7 million people are reported to be affected, of whom nearly 461,000 people, or 91,400 families, have been displaced from their homes. While many roads have reopened and Biratnagar airport is now operational during daylight, according to data from the Nepal Food Security Monitoring System, more than 50 villages remain inaccessible by road. On 25 August, Humanitarian Country Team launched Joint Response Plan, seeking US$41.4 million to provide immediate humanitarian assistance to 1.7 million people comprising health, water sanitation and hygiene (WASH), food security, nutrition, shelter, livelihood, protection, education and early recovery support for the coming six months. As of 20 September, there were 160 reported deaths, along with 43,400 destroyed homes and 191,700 others partially damaged. Nearly 21,000 households were still displaced. Flooding has exacerbated pre-crisis vulnerabilities. According to the Assessment of disaster effects and recovery needs conducted by National Planning Commission (NCP) during August 2017, total damage caused by 2017 floods was USD 584.7 million. Over 1.7 million people in 35 districts were affected.

Rains have been particularly heavy in North Darfur, leaving an estimated 35,000 IDPs, locals and refugees in need of help, and where 15 people have tragically died and a further 23 gone missing. As of 8 September, nearly 100 fatalities, 46 injured people, thousands of people displaced (and many of them sheltered in schools), and over 100,000 houses destroyed or damaged across the aforementioned States. Since mid-July, around 506,000 people have been affected across 17 States (out of 18), with more than 110,000 of them during the first week of September. In the Khartoum State around 100,000 people are currently in need of urgent shelters, household supplies, clean water, sanitation, and health services. Over the next 24 hours, moderate rain is forecast over south-west and south-east Sudan, with locally heavy rain over central North Kordofan State. At least 111,000 houses were either destroyed or severely damaged by floodwater and the number of people critically affected exceeds 770,000. Nearly 16,000 latrines were destroyed and the collapse of the Bout Dam hinders access to water to more than 100,000 people in Blue Nile State, but all 18 States of the country have been affected. There is a need for food, shelter, hygiene and sanitation items to assist those affected. Two weeks ago, the Government declared a State of Emergency in the country due to the unprecedented flooding. Light to locally moderate rain is forecast over southern Sudan on 22-23 September. Rains started to subside and flood waters are receding in Sudan, after months of heavy rainfall that left more than 875,000 people affected by unprecedented flooding. Torrential downpours, landslides, flash and riverine flooding have killed over 150 people and left a path of destruction in all states across the country, according to the Government's Humanitarian Aid Commission data. More than 30 per cent of the water samples analyzed across 13 states were contaminated and the extensive damage to hundreds of water sources, the collapse of several thousands of latrines increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks. Over 10 million people are now at risk of contracting water-borne diseases, and more than 4.5 million are exposed to vector-borne diseases, an increase of nearly 100 per cent if compared with April 2020.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"National authorities and humanitarian partners are monitoring the situation and are providing relief to those affected.

Tropical storm Ana, whose force has already been perceived in some provinces, could cause windspeeds up to 100km/h and rains up to 200mm/24h, potentially impacting the northern and central provinces of Nampula, Zambezia, Sofala, Manica, Tete, Niassa, and Cabo Delgado. Over the coming day, heavy rains and strong winds could cause population displacements, flooding and damages to public and private infrastructures. An estimated 500,000 people may be impacted across the three provinces of Nampula, Zambezia and Sofala, including 120,000 women and girls of reproductive age (aged 10-49) and 14,000 pregnant women, according to national authorities. Tropical storm Ana made landfall in Angoche district, Nampula province on 24 January and subsequently headed westwards, affecting the northern part of Zambezia province and the southern part of Tete province. According to INGD, the storm already resulted in some 4,000 people affected, 66 people injured and five people killed. A total of 546 private houses were also partially destroyed while 115 were totally destroyed. Moreover, one health center and 16 classrooms were affected. On 25 January, a general power cut has been reported in the provinces of Zambezia, Nampula, and Cabo Delgado, following damages caused on the main electricity line. In Tete province, the bridge over the Rovubue river, between Tete Sede and Moaztize, collapsed due to the heavy flow of water. In Nampula, the connection between Nampula Sede and Angoche has been interrupted due to the overflow of the Luazi River. In Zambezia, the Licungo River exceeded the alert level, causing moderate to high floods in the districts of Mocuba, Maganja da Costa, and Namacurra. Moreover, several roads are under the water and two bridges have been destroyed between Mocuba and Lugela. Over the past 24 hours, tropical storm Ana turned into a tropical depression system, according to the National Institute of Meteorology (INAM). However, serious concerns remain about widespread floods, displacements, damages to critical public infrastructures, private houses as well as the interruption of basic services, as heavy rains and strong winds continue to hit. As per final analysis, following the passage of tropical storm Ana, 185,429 people were affected, 207 people were injured, and at least 38 people died. The storm destroyed 11,757 houses and damaged 26 health centers, 25 water supply systems, 138 power poles, and 2,275 km of roads, according to the latest data released by INGD. It affected 126,265 hectares, with serious concern about the impact on crop production and food security. In fact, according to Fews Net, households impacted by tropical storm Ana are expected to face stressed (IPC2) and crisis (IPC3) levels of food security in the upcoming months. The storm also damaged 781 schools and destroyed 1,608 classrooms, impacting a total of 209,581 students. Tropical Storm Ana also caused the displacement of some 2,200 Mozambican families, mostly from the districts of Mutarara (Tete) and Morrumbala (Zambezia), to the district of Nsanje in Malawi, according to recent data published by INGD.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"On 25 February, a Malawi-specific Flash Appeal was released, calling for US$29.4 million for humanitarian partners to target close to 542,000 people.

As of 14 November, in Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and Dominica, approximately 70 per cent of the population has access to restored water services, while power services coverage ranges from 70 per cent in Turk and Caicos Islands (TCI) to 10 percent in Dominica. There has also been a notable reduction in the number of displaced people living in official shelters in BVI and Dominica. In Dominica, this includes a 60 per cent decrease over the last few weeks. The majority of children in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, British Virgin Islands, and Turk and Caicos Islands have now gone back to school, with all public schools reopening. However, in Dominica just around a third of national schools were open as of 10 November, and 87 per cent of children living in collective shelters still do not have access to any type of education, and are missing out on valuable months of their schooling, which could have implications on the quality of their education. For Dominica, The Post-Disaster Needs Assessment concluded that Hurricane Maria resulted in total damages of EC$2.51 billion (US$931 million) and losses of EC$1.03 billion (US$382 million), which amounts to 226 percent of 2016 gross domestic product (GDP). The identified recovery needs for reconstruction and resilience interventions, incorporating the principle of \u2018building back better\u2019 (BBB) where possible, amount to EC$3.69 billion (US$1.37 billion). The European Commission has provided \u20ac500,000 to UNICEF to support Dominica\u2019s education sector in the wake of the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria last September. The EU-UNICEF project aims to fill this gap. The 11-month project will target 1,500 primary school children in the 20 most severely damaged schools. Each school will get a library and a range of teaching materials, including text books and workbooks. At almost four months after Hurricane Maria hit Dominica, only around 10 per cent of people, mainly in the cities of Roseau and Portsmouth, have access to electricity. The Dominica Electricity Services reported that services are in process of being restored throughout the island. Diverse foodstuffs have reappeared on the markets, shops are reopening, most public schools have reopened, and 30 out of 43 damaged water systems have been provisionally repaired. The curfew was lifted in Roseau on 8 December. Nevertheless, Dominica remains seriously impacted. Over 80 percent of houses still have inadequate roofing, many children have not yet returned to school and a sizeable portion of the population is highly vulnerable due to the loss of their main source of livelihoods. To date, 8 collection centres are still open. The humanitarian actors have mostly transitioned from relief activities to recovery, and coordination mechanisms are reflecting this shift. A growing number of ministries and stakeholders take part in sector coordination mechanisms, which is conducive to more comprehensive and complementary action plans.

The infectious risk seems confined to Am Timan and immediate surroundings. However, the event remains under close monitoring at all levels of WHO. The outbreak of hepatitis E in the Salamat region of Chad continues to evolve, with one new district being affected. The potential of the outbreak to escalate is high given the prevailing predisposing factors. Only 25% of the 63,000 people in Am Timan, the epicenter of the outbreak, have access to clean and safe water. Meanwhile, about 30% of the 13,000 people in Aboude\u00efa have access to safe water. The local community continues to fetch and drink water from rain pools (ponds), sharing with animals and birds. The affected communities also have poor sanitation, commonly practicing free range open defecation. With these factors, in addition to the onset of rainy season expected soon, the risk of further spread of hepatitis E, as well as of cholera, remains very high. Since September 2016, 1,684 suspected cases of Hepatitis E (77 in July) have been reported in the 3 health districts of Salamat, of which 230 cases were tested and 130 of these confirmed positive (positive rate of 52.2%); 16 deaths have so far been reported (no death this month). As the Ministry of Public Health officially declared a Hepatitis E epidemic in the region of Salamat, the epidemiologic surveillance has been extended to the region\u2019s 3 health districts and the 42 areas of responsibility (12 in Aboudeia, 18 in Am Timan, and 12 in Haraze health districts). Outbreaks occurred in the Salamat Region, predominantly affecting North and South Am Timan, Amsin\u00e9n\u00e9, Mouraye, Foulonga, and Aboudeia. The number of cases decreased since week 39. Of the 64 cases in pregnant women, five died (CFR: 7.8%) and 20 were hospitalized. Water chlorination activities were stopped at the end of September 2017 due to a lack of partners and financial means.

The heavy downpour caused water surges and landslides on Gunung Jerai that later hit Yan, Kuala Muda, and Bandar Baharu district in Kedah with muddy flash floods. The surrounding location of Gunung Jerai Resort was severely damaged. Difficulty in road access from the affected flash flood sites hampered the search and rescue of the casualties believed to have drowned and been swept away by the strong current. The flash floods have affected approximately 879 families (4,395 people) in the affected area of Yan district and 86 families (430 people) in Kubang Pasu district. The data collected is based on the district office in Yan and Kuala Muda as of 22 August 2021. The Government opened two evacuation centres and hosted 43 people for short-term assistance. Currently, the evacuation centres had been closed. Out of 4,825 people affected by the flash flood, only 43 people went to the evacuation centres. People from the affected flash flood villages were hesitant to evacuate to the centres due to the fear of COVID-19 transmission. COVID-19 cases in the Yan district are considered high at the state level. For Yan district, 395 positive COVID-19 cases have been reported, and in Kuala Muda district, figures have reached 6,285 cases. Carrying sediment and large tree trunks, the flash floods impacted nearby houses in the Kampung Pematang Keramat. Most of the houses in this village are 2 km from the primary impact area of the foothill of Gunung Jerai. The affected houses are covered in mud, some with minor damage. Villages affected by the flash flood were covered with mud and sand on the houses since 18 August 2021. Of the three affected locations, the Yan district is the most affected location. Heavy rains poured a massive volume of water down a stream from Gunung Jerai, sweeping tree trunks and rocks through two km of the surrounding area. The ensuing floods destroyed local village livestock and vegetable farms. Local authorities have confirmed six deaths. In Kuala Muda district, most areas were covered with muddy water, tree trunks, and large rocks from the side of the river. Despite mud covering houses, flood victims did not report heavy damage. People did, however, report damage to several home appliances and furniture. The walls of a few residences are damaged, smashed by rocks from the nearby river. Most of the houses are built with concrete structures and wood materials. A river overflowed in Banda Baharu district, as heavy downpour caused pressure on a dam, flooded its water capacity and impacted poor drainage systems. Houses in this district were covered with muddy water with 25 people affected, and local authorities are providing assistance to this district. In the two districts of Yan and Kuala Muda, flash floods destroyed farmland and plantations. Livestock loss such as chickens, goats, and cows was also reported, which are critical livelihood or safety net assets for the affected. Some farmers reportedly lost harvests due to the flood, which is significant as the rice harvest is due later this month. Kedah state is currently experiencing the third wave of COVID-19, with cases escalating in the last two weeks, reaching 1,538 new cases per day and 24,306 active cases. Kedah state is the seventh highest state with COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, reporting 89,027 cases as of 26 August 2021.

This disaster occurred just two weeks after Cyclone Mora killed 9 people and caused significant damage across the region. In addition to mudslides, the rains caused severe flooding in low-lying areas, causing significant damage to road and communication infrastructure. Remote communities in Bandarban, Chittagong and Rangamati districts have been cut off and remain without water, electricity, and food supplies. Communities of Rohingya refugees in Bandarban district may also have been affected. Further mudslides are feared due to continued rainfall. The total estimated death toll currently stands at 98 from Rangamati district, 30 from Chittagong district and 7 from Bandarban district. Many others are injured and in need of medical assistance. Renewed mudslides in south-eastern Bangladesh have claimed additional lives and further damage to homes and infrastructure. Collapsing hillsides and heavy flooding are now estimated to have killed over 150 people across five districts. As of 16 June, floods and landslides in the Chittagong Hill Tract region and surrounding areas have killed 156 people. According to UNICEF, 30 to 40 per cent of water points in the affected areas are flooded. The June landslides, which started on 13 June with a few episodes, resulted in heavy loss of life (160 persons), injury (187 persons), and destruction of houses (6,000 structures) and other key infrastructures despite being localized in impact. It is the worst landslide-related disaster since 2007. It affected about 80,000 persons across five districts: Bandarban, Chittagong, Cox\u2019s Bazar, Khagrachari and, Rangamati. Among these people, 34,000 were severely impacted as they lost their houses together with their belongings, basic necessities, livelihoods and food stocks. Approximately 46% of the most affected persons are from Rangamati, 25% from Bandarban, 25% from Chittagong, 2% from Cox\u2019s Bazar and, 1% from Khagrachari. Monsoon rains have triggered flooding across 11 districts in northeastern Bangladesh, affecting at least 1.3 million people as of 16 July. NGO partners report that vast areas of Moulvibazar and Sylhet remain under water affecting agricultural livelihoods. The Government has released cash grants and distributed food to the affected districts. On 22 and 23 July, new landslides affected the district of Bandarban in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, with preliminary reports indicating that 6 people have died and 4 people are still missing. Currently, 1,500 people in eight shelter camps are still receiving emergency shelter assistance and food assistance from national authorities. Complementing the government\u2019s efforts, several humanitarian partners are providing shelter assistance, psychosocial support, NFIs and cash for food to 4,300 households. Other agencies are providing shelter, WASH and Sexual and Reproductive Health assistance to 1,500 households. As of the end of July 2017, national authorities are sheltering roughly 1,500 persons, who receive three cooked meals per day. National authorities are also supporting landslide victims (the families of dead or injured people) through the provision of cash and food packages. According to the government, some 39,164 persons remain severely affected in Bandarban and Rangamati districts. Flooding has affected the eastern, southern and northern regions of Bangladesh. As of 14 August, 12 deaths have been confirmed, including six children. An estimated 586,000 people in 356 unions of 20 upazilas have been affected. The Government has opened 973 emergency flood shelters, hosting an estimated 68,500 people. The waters of 23 rivers have risen beyond the danger line and further heavy rain and an increased risk of landslides is forecast for coming days. The Government has allocated 31 million BDT and 10,630 MT of rice to flood-affected districts. As of 20 August, 5.7 million people in 27 districts have been affected by floods with 300,000 people in emergency shelters, and 98 people known to have died. Access to affected areas is restricted with roads and bridges damaged. The Government allocated US$820,000 as well as rice and dry food parcels, and 1,945 local medical teams have deployed to prevent outbreaks of disease. As of 27 August, the Government of Bangladesh reports that the floods have affected 32 districts in the northern, north eastern and central parts of the country due to the overflowing of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna river, affecting a total of more than 8 million people. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) informs that 335 shelters in flood-affected areas are sheltering more than 106,000 people. On 1 September 2017, the HCTT launched an Emergency Response Plan to complement the timely and effective response by the Government of Bangladesh. The plan is seeking US$12 million to provide immediate humanitarian assistance to 330,000 people (45 per cent men, 55 per cent women, 51 per cent children) (66,000 HH) for the next 6 months (August 2017 \u2013 January 2018), primarily in the six most affected districts: Gaibhandha, Dinajpur, Kurigram, Amalpur, Nilphamari and Sirajganj. As of 18 September, floodwaters had begun to recede in 30 of the 32 affected districts, according to the MoDMR. An estimated total of 103,855 houses are reported to have been destroyed and 633,792 have been partially damaged; 145 persons are known to have lost their lives due to the floods. According to an assessment conducted by the Shelter Cluster on 6-9 September 2017, vulnerable, marginalized and poorer communities were the worst affected by the floods, especially communities building with mud-houses or living on chars and embankments. While many are recovering, there remain specific groups that still have urgent needs for emergency shelter support. As of 28 September, widespread flooding has killed 145 people, affected 8 million people across 32 districts, destroyed 103,855 houses, and damaged 4,636 education infrastructure. According to the needs analysis report issued on 20 September, the priority concerns of flood-affected communities are food security, livelihood and shelter. In the flood-affected areas, most of the crop lands has been submerged for at least 5-7 days causing damage to crops, houses, infrastructures. Most of the houses are made of mud and straw and they have been fully damaged.

Lack of rain led to losses of over 90,000 metric tons of corn, one of the main staple foods in the country. The eastern part of the country has reported 33 consecutive days without rain and record temperatures reaching 41\u00b0C. The Government of Honduras declared State of Emergency in the Dry Corridor from August 15th until December 31st, 2018, to address the lack of water provoking a loss of crops. The drought, triggered by El Ni\u00f1o, affects 145 municipalities from 13 departments. 74 of those municipalities with 65,000 families are suffering a severe drought. The decree was recommended by FAO, WFP and the National Risk Management System (Sinager). FAO and WFP expressed concern over the drought that has caused major crop losses in Central America. The agencies also warned that the possible arrival of an El Ni\u00f1o before the end of 2018 could exacerbate the precarious food and nutrition security of vulnerable rural communities. The months of June and July registered lower-than-average rainfall and drier-than-average conditions, which affected the first and principal crop cycle in Central America, known as the \u201cprimera\u201d. Total or partial loss of crops means that subsistence farmers and their families will not have enough food to eat or sell in coming months. In the Dry Corridor in Central America, during the peak season of casual labor demand, households affected by the extended dry spell will be able to cover the minimal calorie intake requirements and will be classified in Stress (IPC, Phase 2), until at least January 2019. However, certain households may face Crisis (IPC, Phase 3) outcomes without changing the area classification. The number of households in Crisis (IPC, Phase 3) will increase through the lean season. Maize prices in Central America are showing a seasonal decrease started in September after the Primera harvest and remain slightly above the average, except in Nicaragua where they remain significantly above average due to market disruptions from the ongoing political crisis. Bean prices follow a seasonal trend and remain slightly below average. In Haiti maize and black bean prices show a stable trend while imported rice remains above average. Until January 2019, the dry corridor of Central America and certain areas in Haiti (Nord, Nord-Est and Ouest) that were affected by the rain deficit are classified in Stress (IPC, Phase 2), while the rest of the region faces Minimum (IPC, Phase 1) food insecurity. Most households through the region are facing Stressed (IPC Phase 2) food security outcomes. A limited population in drought affected areas in Haiti, Central American Dry Corridor and areas in Guatemala with limited coffee labor income are seeing their livelihoods disrupted and are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). The number of households in this situation will increase as the lean season advances. The poorest households of subsistence farming in the Dry Corridor of Central America and certain areas in Haiti who suffered crop losses are relying on the market earlier than usual and are engaging in Crisis coping strategies. They will be facing Crisis (IPC, Phase 3) Food Security outcomes, particularly in Haiti, Guatemala and Honduras. The rest of the region will be in Stressed or Minimal (IPC, Phase 1 and 2) Food Insecurity. The Central American Climate Outlook Forum forecasted below average cumulated precipitations for the August \u2013 October period, particularly in localized areas of Honduras and Nicaragua.

According to the data provided by the Global Drought Observatory (GDO), a high risk of drought and arid conditions are observed in several regions of the country (Mangystau, Turkestan, Kyzylorda). As a result of the abnormally high air temperature in various country regions, rapid runoff of rivers and reservoirs occurs. As a result, the soil dries up to a depth of 50 cm, which causes a lack of vegetation and natural feed on pastures. Due to the impossibility of grazing livestock, the minimum reserves of feed and water are exhausted, which leads to the mass death of animals. To date, the end of more than 2,000 units of livestock has been recorded in the target regions, and this figure is increasing every day. In addition, crops are also being destroyed by the heat, which can potentially lead to a major food crisis in several regions of the country, where cattle are a key object of vital activity due to the geographical and climatic features of the southern and western parts of Kazakhstan.

The Ethiopian highlands, which contribute to the Juba and Shabelle river flow, continued to receive moderate rains over the last one week. The 2020 Deyr rainy season has started with moderate to significantly heavy rains reported in Puntland and central regions of Hiraan, Bakool, Galgaduud, Mudug, Nugaal and southern areas of Sool region. The communities living in the riverine areas along Juba and Shabelle rivers are at high risk of flooding.

It was located about 175 KM west of Torres and 300 KM west northwest of Gaua (Torba Province) in Northern Vanuatu. The Government of Vanuatu raised the alert levels across the northern provinces...Public alerts were issued over radio and via mass text messages sent out by Telecom Vanuatu and Digicel. As of 6 May 2017, Torba Province in Northern Vanuatu was the most affected area. According to a quick rapid assessment with Community Disaster Committees on the four islands (Loh, Hui, Tegua and Toga), significant number of houses have been either totally destroyed or damaged. On Loh island, almost all people are sheltered in an evacuation center. On 8 May, Tropical Cyclone Donna intensified into a Category 5 storm (winds of up to 215 km/h near the centre and gusts of 300 km/h) as it continues to move across Vanuatu towards New Caledonia. Over the weekend, Torba Province, with a population of about 10,000 people, was severely hit...Preliminary reports indicate significant housing damage; however, communication remain disrupted. The National Emergency Operations Centre was activated and is coordinating the in-country response. No fatalities have been confirmed. Tropical Cyclone Donna has passed out of the Vanuatu region and the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) gave the all clear on the 9th of May...The Torres Island group in Torba Province remains the most affected area, with other areas in Torba less affected.

Based on the attack rate projections another 36,000 to 40,000 cases are expected over the next six to nine months, according to the FMoH and WHO. The AWD is affecting all demographics, with females constituting 54 per cent of the cases and children under five years of age accounting for 8.1 per cent. Only 78 new cases of AWD and two related deaths were reported from 8 to 14 October, down from a peak of nearly 2,000 new cases at the end of June 2017. Eight states reported active case transmissions and the only state reporting two AWD-related deaths was South Kordofan.

The number of reported AWD cases remains low across Sudan, with 98 cases registered during the last four weeks (17 December 2017 \u2013 13 January 2018), according to FMoH and WHO. The most recent deaths\u2014two in Red Sea State\u2014were reported during Week 1, with no deaths before that since Week 47.

The country, where groundwater is the primary source of water, has a long history of inefficiency in its water distribution network, particularly in the agricultural sector. Despite not experiencing food insecurity, Iran faces paramount challenges in safeguarding long-term water access during the dry spell. All sectors that rely on the water are exposed, from agriculture to power production and public water supply. Currently, from 2 to 20 million people are at high to medium risk of drought-related impacts. On top of poor precipitation during the 2020-2021 winter, high temperatures have caused more snow to melt, reducing the amount of water stored for later use during the drier months (i.e., late spring and summer). The IRCS estimates that 4.8 million people are at medium to high risk of drought-related impacts, mostly in remote and rural areas of the provinces. The Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) reports that 29 of 31 provinces, and especially seven \u2013 South Khorasan, Kerman, Sistan Balochistan, Hormozgan, Khuzestan, Isfahan, Khorasan Razavi \u2013 have been severely affected by the drought. The drought has brought widespread reliance on water trucking and bottled water for drinking. Many individuals or households have moved from rural to urban areas, resulting in the abandonment of villages in rural areas and the worsening of living conditions in urban areas. The IRCS reports the drought has exacerbated the existing vulnerabilities and social marginalization of women. Drought places additional burdens on women in terms of their responsibilities around household care. Moreover, the migration of predominantly young men distorts the gender balance in the urban centres.

Those affects are now emerging in other areas of the country, specifically in Jubaland in the south. Somaliland and Puntland have experienced below average rains for up to four seasons, spanning two years, and affecting nearly 1.4 million people. The humanitarian situation in Somalia is rapidly deteriorating and famine is a strong possibility in 2017. This comes only six years after a devastating famine led to the death of more than a quarter of a million people \u2013 half of them children. The severe drought is a result of two consecutive seasons of poor rainfall, more in some areas. In the worst affected areas, large-scale crop failure and high levels of livestock deaths are occurring. Malnutrition and drought-related diseases are on the rise, so are displacements, including to Ethiopia. Increasing competition for resources such as water is already increasing local tensions and could trigger further inter-communal conflict. Over 6.2 million people-half the population-are in need of humanitarian assistance. The situation of children of Somalia is particularly grave. As of 31 May 2017, there had been an estimated 739,000 drought displacements since November 2016...More than 480,000 of the displaced, or 65 per cent, are under the age of 18. Moreover, people under 5 years old represent more than one-quarter (195,000) of all those displaced \u2014 and are the most at risk of malnutrition and disease. 3.2 million people are severely food insecure. This situation is expected to persist throughout 2017 given the high likelihood of a third consecutive poor harvest in July. Access to food is relatively better than previously projected due to large-scale humanitarian assistance...102,263 people have been treated for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) since January. SAM admissions have increased by more than 50% since 2016. The Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU)\u2019s post-Jilaal 2017 survey indicates a high prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (15% to 30%) in the Bay, Bakool, Sool, Sanaag, Bari and Nugal regions, as well as in Baidoa and Mogadishu IDP camps. While the latest FSNAU assessments show a decrease of the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance from 6.7 million to 6.2 million people, the threat of localized famine countered by scaled-up humanitarian response is as relevant today as it was in the first months of this crisis. The Gu harvest will provide temporary relief for some communities in terms of food availability, but the harvest is reduced due to poor rains and access to food remains constrained. Prices will remain elevated through at least early 2018. Malnutrition, one of the leading indicators of the crisis, has reached emergency levels in a number of locations in southern and central Somalia, primarily, though not exclusively among displaced populations. Overall, some 388,000 acutely malnourished children are in need of critical nutrition support, including life-saving treatment for more than 87,000 severely malnourished children. Nearly 895,000 internally displaced people due to drought and conflict rely almost exclusively on assistance for basic services and life support. Major AWD/Cholera and measles outbreaks are also of continued concern. Through robust humanitarian assistance and the modest benefits from the underperforming Gu rains, the situation has stabilized but remains of serious concern at emergency levels. Whereas there is a modest decline in the number of people in need, there is an increase in the number of persons in the emergency-phase (IPC 4) compared to the previous assessment. When the threat of famine was announced in February, the number of people in need stood at 6.2 million. Humanitarian partners are closely following what could become another failed rainy season in a context of continued risk of famine and deteriorating humanitarian indicators. According to the October Rainfall Update for Somalia by the FAO-managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the Deyr 2017 rainy season, which usually runs from October to December, kicked off in the last week of September in the north eastern areas and second week of October in southern and central regions. Many places in Bay, Bakool, Gedo and Middle Juba received rains at the start of the season. Food security is expected to improve for agricultural and agropastoral households in January with the Deyr harvest. In both areas, though, improvements will be short\u2010lived and many households will face food consumption gaps through mid\u20102018. In a worst\u2010case scenario of an extended absence of assistance, Famine (IPC Phase 5) remains possible, and continued large\u2010scale assistance is needed throughout 2018 to protect lives and livelihoods. Food security has improved significantly in many of the areas worstaffected by the 2016/17 drought, as a result of large-scale humanitarian assistance and improvements in seasonal performance. Most areas of the country are currently Stressed (IPC Phase 2), though Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes exist in some areas and among IDP populations. Between July and September, in the absence of continued humanitarian assistance, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely in riverine livelihood zones and northern and central Somalia. Emergency (IPC Phase 4) is likely in Guban Pastoral livelihood zone. The record levels of rainfall seen during the April \u2013 June Gu rainy season have ushered in hopes of the substantial replenishment of water resources, and the restoration of cropland and livestock numbers across many areas of Somalia. The latest food security outlook by the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) and the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) reports that food security will improve significantly in many of the areas worst-affected by the 2016/17 drought, as a result of improvements in seasonal performance supported by large-scale humanitarian assistance. However, the magnitude and intensity of the rains, coupled with the subsequent flooding, has aggravated vulnerabilities. Vulnerable communities, still recovering from the adverse effects of protracted drought, are among those who have been most severely affected by flooding. Due to the above-average rains in the first half of 2018 and sustained humanitarian assistance, the number of people facing severe food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above) has decreased by 52 per cent from 3.1 million in September 2017 to 1.5 million in September 2018. However, the IPC Phase 2 caseload remained virtually unchanged, with a reduction of only 0.6 per cent. Due to the mid-2018 Gu rainy season, total cereal production exceeded the long-term average (1995-2017) by approximately 17 per cent and is 58 per cent higher than the five-year average (2013-17). Favourable rainfall between April and June 2018 also improved pasture and water availability for livestock and bolstered market conditions in some areas. Notwithstanding the relative improvement in food security outcomes since the end of the 2016/17 drought, similar gains were not observed with respect to malnutrition, which is influenced by several factors, including healthcare, clean water, proper sanitation and good hygiene practices. Malnutrition rates across Somalia remain very high and, in 2019, nearly 1 million children will be acutely malnourished, including more than 177,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. The combined impact of the initial, and potentially complete, failure of the 2019 Gu\u2019 rains (April-June), which followed a poor 2018 Deyr season (October-December), and abnormally hot, dry conditions during the 2019 Jilaal season (January-March) has caused widespread crop failure and accelerated decline in livestock productivity, rapidly pushing communities in the worst-affected areas into food insecurity crisis phase, or worse. The signs of crisis, such as irregular pastoral migration coupled with deteriorating livestock body conditions and reduction in milk production, increased displacement due to drought and increases in drought-related disease, are already widely observed. Out of 5.4 million expected to be acutely food insecure by July, 2.2 million will be in severe acute food insecurity conditions (IPC 3 and above), a 40 per cent increase from January this year. Two years after the prolonged 2016/2017 drought destroyed livelihoods and displaced almost one million Somalis - but also triggered a massive and successful scale up in humanitarian response to avert famine - severe climatic conditions, combined with other persistent drivers of humanitarian crisis, armed conflict, protracted and continued displacement and a spike in evictions of internally displaced persons are again pushing Somalia towards a major humanitarian emergency. The Horn of Africa (HoA) (including northeast Uganda) is currently experiencing a prolonged drought, largely as a result of below average precipitation from the seasonal short rains (April-July) and long rains (October-December). Prevailing dry conditions across the region have led to the deterioration of farmland and pastures, loss of livestock, sharply increased food prices, and reduction of the availability of water in large areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. At the regional level, the number of severely food insecure people has increased to approximately 12 million, in large part as a result of the drought. Pre-existing protection, health, WASH, and shelter needs have been also been exacerbated. The humanitarian needs of the region\u2019s growing displaced population are of particular concern. Climatic shocks, conflict, natural disasters, widespread poverty, insecurity and vulnerability have trapped millions of Somalis in severe hunger and malnutrition for years. Late and erratic rains during the 2019 Gu\u2019 cropping season (April-June) coupled with low river levels resulted in the poorest cereal harvest since 2011, which shattered the already fragile food security situation in the country. According to the 2019 Post-Gu\u2019 results cereal production was up to 70 per cent below average in the southern areas for the Gu\u2019 2019 cropping season. If timely assistance is not provided, some 2.2 million people are expected to experience Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food security outcomes through December, and one million children are projected to be acutely malnourished in 2020, including 180,000 who are likely to be severely malnourished. On the upside, the October-December 2019 Deyr rains forecast and initial performance has been positive, which would lead to improvements in food security. Most of the main IDP settlements are currently classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Given the level of destitution among IDPs and their limited livelihood options, their food security situation is unlikely to improve significantly during the projection period (February-June 2020). Urban Beletwyene is currently classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2) when considering the positive impact of humanitarian assistance. Food security outcomes are expected to deteriorate to Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between December 2019 and June 2022 as they will be facing food consumption gasps that they will not be able to reduce without continued humanitarian assistance. General acute malnutrition (GAM) is above the 15 per cent threshold in 10 of the 33 areas which experienced below average rainfall in 2019. Up to 178,000 children are expected to be impacted by severe acute malnutrition (SAM) between July 2019 and June 2020. Adding to these challenges was the presence at the end of 2019 of locusts infesting the countryside and destroying crops. As a result, it is expected in 2020 that up to 2.1 million people are expected to face food consumption gaps with 6.3 million facing acute food insecurity. Despite above-average national cereal crop production and improved livestock production following a largely favorable Deyr (October-December) rainy season, up to 1.3 million people across Somalia are expected to face food consumption gaps or depletion of assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3)1 or worse outcomes through mid-2020. From February to September 2020, the population in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. An additional 2.9 million people are projected to be in IPC Phase 2 (stressed). Humanitarian food assistance needs are high across Somalia, where Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes remain widespread. An estimated 3.5 million people in rural livelihood zones, urban areas, and IDP settlements need food assistance. Furthermore, a long-term decline in rainfall performance and preliminary climatological research suggest an elevated likelihood of below-average rainfall in the March to May 2021 season. Two consecutive poor seasons would likely result in rapidly worsening acute food insecurity in 2021. In late 2020, the population facing food consumption gaps indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes is likely to reach 2.1 million. In early to mid-2021, the acutely food insecure population is likely to rise over 2.5 million due to the impact of consecutive, below-average rainfall seasons on crop and livestock production. Sustained humanitarian food assistance is required to prevent Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes and protect livelihoods. Many parts of Somalia are currently experiencing drought conditions, triggered by below average 2020 Deyr (October-December) season rainfall which was characterized by depressed rains with poor spatial and temporal distributions and harsh conditions during the typically dry Jiaall (January-March) season. The worst affected regions include Lower Juba, Middle Juba, Gedo, Mudug, Nuugal, Bari, Toghdheer and Sool which are currently experiencing severe water shortage for domestic use, water for livestock as well as agricultural production. The already dire humanitarian situation in 2021 will likely be exacerbated by another drought. Already in 2021, more than 80 per cent of the country is experiencing drought conditions. Although the Gu rains started in some parts of the country, forecasts indicate below-average rainfall. At least 3.4 million people are projected to be affected by drought conditions by year end, of whom around 380,000 are expected to be displaced. Nearly 40,000 people are facing mild to moderate drought conditions, as well as moderate to severe water shortages in Puntland, Galmudug, South West, Jubaland states and Banadir region, according to local authorities and partners. The situation resulted from the failure of the October-December 2020 rainy season, a harsh January - March 2021 season and a poorly distributed March-April-June season. The worst affected areas are Middle Juba, Gedo and parts of Bay and Bakool, which are experiencing moderate drought conditions, according to FAO SWALIM. Preliminary indications are that mild to moderate drought conditions may persist in many parts of Somalia until early 2022. Between July and September 2021, over 2.2 million people experienced high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). This figure is projected to drastically increase to 3.5 million between October and December 2021, and include poor rural, urban and displaced populations across Somalia. The projection is based on the assumed absence of humanitarian assistance. Moreover, approximately 1.2 million children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished through July 2022, including nearly 213 400 likely severely malnourished Eighty per cent of Somalia is experiencing severe drought, the result of a third consecutive failed rainfall season. DG ECHO direct monitoring in most affected locations receives multiple community alerts of livestock deaths and humanitarian suffering. Nearly 100,000 people have abandoned their homes in central and southern areas in search of food, water and pasture for their livestock, facing resource-based conflict over the diminishing resources. In Jubaland, the average cost of 20-litres of water has more than doubled and the price of sorghum more than tripled, while the value of livestock (main livelihood) has plummeted: from 250 USD paid per cattle to current 70 USD. The Juba and Shabelle river levels are low and expected to decrease further. Rainwater harvesters and shallow wells have dried up, forcing communities to rely on low yield, poor quality boreholes, heightening risks for multiple diseases. Given the seasonal forecast, with little or no rain expected through the end of November 2021, current and projected drought conditions are the worse in record for past 40 years. 2.6 Million people in Somalia are facing water shortages due to severe drought conditions in Somalia. Water scarcity and drought conditions have contributed to increased water prices leading to displacements, diarrhoea-related morbidity and malnutrition in many parts of Somalia. The current worst affected regions include Gedo, Bay, Bakol, Lower Jubba, Galgadud, Mudug and parts of Bari, Nugaal, Sool, Sanaag, Togdheer, and Hiraan regions. Over 4.1 million people across Somalia, or 26 percent of the total population, need urgent humanitarian food assistance to prevent food consumption gaps or the accelerated depletion of livelihood assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through mid-2022. The key drivers of acute food insecurity in Somalia include the combined effects of consecutive seasons of poor and erratic rainfall distribution and conflict. Moreover, approximately 1.4 million children, or over 44 percent of the children in Somalia under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished, including nearly 329,500 who are likely to be severely malnourished. Acute food insecurity in Somalia has drastically worsened since the beginning of 2022, with an estimated 4.8 million people (or 31% of the total population) already experiencing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) outcomes. Further and faster deterioration of the food security and nutrition situation is expected during the April to June 2022 projection period, when more than 6 million people (or 38% of the total population) are expected to face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) outcomes, including 1.7 million people likely in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and over 81,000 people likely in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). In addition to the six population groups that face the risk of Famine, other areas of humanitarian concern include Southern Agropastoral, Southern Rain-fed Agropastoral of Middle and Lower Juba, and Togdheer Agropastoral livelihood zones as well as IDP settlements in Burao, Garoowe, Belet Weyne, Doolow and Kismaayo, all of which face Emergency (IPC Phase 4) between April and June 2022. The number of people affected by drought has risen from 4.9 million in March to about 6.1 million in April, of whom nearly 760,000 are displaced and in urgent need of shelter, food, water and access to services such as health. Famine (IPC Phase 5) is projected to emerge in three areas of Bay Region, Somalia, in late 2022 in the absence of urgent, multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance. Although levels of acute malnutrition among children and the rate of hunger-related deaths have not yet met the IPC\u2019s technical definition of Famine (IPC Phase 5), those thresholds are expected to be reached during the October to December 2022 projection period based on currently available information that minimal humanitarian food assistance will be delivered in these areas in November and December due to funding constraints. The IPC analysis \u2013 conducted by experts across multiple agencies, including FEWS NET and FSNAU \u2013 has previously warned that up to 7.1 million people across Somalia need urgent, multi-sectoral assistance ii in order to treat and prevent acute malnutrition and reduce the number of ongoing hunger-related deaths. Additionally, for months now FEWS NET, FSNAU, and IPC partners have been warning that eight areas in Somalia, inclusive of Bay, faced a Risk of Famine. iii Although provision of food and nutrition assistance is currently ongoing, levels of assistance have not kept pace with the scale and severity of needs amid a two-year drought, protracted conflict, and record high staple food prices. By the end of September, 1,170,842 people had been displaced by drought since January 2021. Drought displaced 68,393 people in September 2022, a 31 per cent decrease from August 2022. Bay region (26 per cent) and Lower Juba region (22 per cent) have seen the most new arrivals, followed by Gedo, Banadir, and Bakool regions (14 per cent, 11 per cent and 11 per cent respectively). Amid an anticipated scale-down in humanitarian assistance starting in April 2023 due to insufficient funding, approximately 8.3 million people across Somalia are expected to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse acute food insecurity outcomes between April and June 2023. This unprecedented level of need within Somalia is driven by the impacts of five consecutive seasons of poor rainfall, a likely sixth season of below-average rainfall from March to June 2023, and exceptionally high food prices, exacerbated by concurrent conflict/insecurity and disease outbreaks. Furthermore, Famine (IPC Phase 5) is projected between April and June 2023 among agropastoral populations in Baidoa and Burhakaba districts of Bay region and among internally displaced people (IDP) in Baidoa town of Bay region and in Mogadishu. During the IPC analysis conducted in January 2023, three population groups were identified as facing a Risk of Famine between April and June 2023: agropastoral communities in Burhakaba district (Bay region), internally displaced people (IDPs) in Mogadishu settlements, and IDPs in Baidoa settlements. In March 2023, follow-up integrated food security, nutrition, and mortality surveys were conducted in these three areas in order to monitor the current situation. The survey conducted in agropastoral Burhakaba also included agropastoral populations in Baidoa district given the recent history of extreme food insecurity, nutrition, and mortality outcomes in Baidoa and the resultant need for updated information in the district. In April 2023, an IPC analysis update was conducted for the surveyed areas. For the rest of the country, the results of the February 2023 IPC analysis remain valid.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Large-scale humanitarian assistance has been provided, including treatment for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and food security interventions.

The epidemiological events that aroused suspicion date back to early July 2021 following an increase in deaths in a clinical context of fever, headache, stiff neck, suggestive of meningitis. However, preliminary investigations helped to establish that the health events observed date back to the beginning of June 2021 in two mining sites in the health area of Panga, health zone of Banalia, located north of Kisangani, capital of Tshopo province. According to the WHO epidemiological bulletin dated 13 September 2021, 301 suspected cases of meningitis, including 131 deaths, have been recorded since the beginning of the epidemic. WHO further highlights the notification of 39 new suspected cases between 10 and 11 September 2021.

The most commonly reported events were wind, rain and storms, affecting over 180 Rohingya refugees. During the reporting period, from 20 to 27 June 2019, some 182 refugees were affected by monsoon-related events. The heaviest monsoon impact this week was recorded on the 21st of June, with windstorms and landslides affecting almost 100 people. Cumulatively, since 21st April, at least 22,000 refugees have been affected by landslides/erosions, wind, storm and rain. Three days of continuous rain in Bangladesh have destroyed 273 shelters and injured 11 people in the Cox\u2019s Bazar settlements where more than 900,000 Rohingya refugees live. An estimated 350mm of rain fell in 72 hours from Monday and more heavy downpours are expected throughout next week, with four months of the monsoon season to go. According to preliminary reports, there have been 26 landslides. From 1 to 7 July, 136 natural disaster related incidents were reported affecting nearly 18,000 people in the Cox\u2019s Bazar refugee camps as a result of the monsoon. 3,230 people were displaced, 16 injured and 2 were killed, including one child. The incidents also caused damage to infrastructure within the camps, with nearly 3,800 shelters and facilities reported to have been damaged or destroyed. The humanitarian community have responded to these needs either from resources available in the camp, or for 10 incidents, through sectoral/emergency programmes. Since the beginning of the rainy season in late April, nearly 38,500 people have been affected, 4,500 displaced, 61 people injured, and eight killed. According to the ISCG daily incident report, 5 landslide, 10 storm and 1 flooding incidents were reported on 11 July, affecting 1,232 people in the camps including 195 individuals temporarily displaced, and 39 shelter and 22 WASH facilities were damaged. Since 2 July, a total of 46,685 people have been affected, and 5,835 displaced within refugee camps in Ukhia and Teknaf Upazilas of Cox\u2019s Bazar. Two deaths have been reported. As of 16 July 2019, 21 low-lying districts in Bangladesh are flooded and 3 districts are affected by river bank erosion. Over 20 million people have been affected and 30 people have died since 13 July 2019. People have been marooned in their homes, schools have been closed and, in some cases, eroded to rivers, crops have been damaged, and livelihoods disrupted. Over 20 river stations are flowing over the warning level. Forecasts show that the situation may deteriorate in the northern most districts whilst improving in the north-western districts. Continuous monsoon rains have impacted several districts in the north, north-east and south-east of the country, resulting in flooding and landslides. As of 19 July, 37 people are dead. According to Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, more than 4.7 million people have been affected and at least 135,600 houses have been damaged. On 16 July, the Jamuna river broke its banks, inundating at least 40 villages and displacing more than 200,000 people. Several rivers have reached dangerous levels in 23 points across the country. Rescue and aid operations have been hampered by road and communication interruptions caused by floods and landslides. Shortages of food and drinking water have resulted in an outbreak of water-borne diseases in several areas. As of 21 July, about 4 million people have been affected by flood and landslides, 36 people reportedly killed, and more than 187,000 people displaced, according to the Government. Schools in most affected areas are being used as shelters. Response is ongoing and the government authorities have distributed relief items. About 2,000 emergency health support teams are operational in 20 districts. Forecasts suggest that another round of heavy rainfall could result in additional flooding and landslides in Bangladesh and surrounding areas from late July into early August. Monsoon rains continue to affect most of the country (particularly northern, north-eastern and south-eastern Divisions). The most affected Districts are Kurigram, Jamalpur, Gaibandha, Sirajganj, Sunamganj, Bogura and Bandarban. The UN Resident Coordinator for Bangladesh reports 71 fatalities across 21 Districts, more than 287,000 people displaced and around 4 million people affected. In addition, the same source reports more than 27,000 houses destroyed and approximately 419,000 houses damaged. As of 30 July, the number of fatalities caused by heavy monsoon rainfall has reached 119. According to the UN assessment, 7.3 million people have been directly affected by monsoon floods throughout the country, and an estimated 308,000 people have been displaced. 85% of the overall displacement has occurred in the nine most affected districts Jamalpur, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Sylhet, Sirajganj, Tangail, Sunamganj, Bogra, Bandarban. Approximately 584,000 houses are damaged or destroyed, while flooding has damaged transport infrastructure, including 6,641 kilometres of road and 1,275 bridges. There is a high risk of water-related diseases and infections. As of 5 August, 7.6 million persons in 28 districts are affected by the monsoon floods. More than half a million houses were damaged or destroyed and 300,000 persons were displaced. Nine districts are severely impacted: Bogra, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Kurigram, Sirajganj, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Tangail and, Bandarban. The latter faced landslides and flashfloods. The number of deaths remain at 119. Monsoon rains have continued to cause damages and to displace people across 28 districts in Bangladesh, including damages to 6,641 kilometers of roads, 1,275 bridges and culverts, and 1,515 kilometers of embankments. Over 260,000 people been displaced, with most housed in makeshift shelters or on embankments. While some people have started to return in areas where waters have receded, riverbank erosion has permanently destroyed homes and settlements in other areas. In Cox\u2019s Bazar, heavy Monsoon rains in the last 24 hours caused several localised landslides and flooding in Rohingya refugee camps and host communities. Among host communities, 3 children died and 18 others were injured as a result of landslides and drowning. Among the Rohingya refugee population, 22 incidents were reported that resulted in the displacement of 2,264 people and injuring 72. 354 shelters, 88 latrines and 4 water points were also damaged. More heavy rain and thunderstorms are forecast in the region over the next 24 hours. From September 6 to 12, heavy monsoon rains have affected over 28,000 refugees in Cox's Bazaar. Of these, 19,108 refugees have been affected by 16 floods and over two thousand refugees have been affected by 46 slope failures. Over 1,800 households were reported as having damaged shelters and over 10,000 people have been displaced within the camps, with the Teknaf Upazila camps of Leda and Nayapara being primarily affected. Response is ongoing through the Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) and the Government of Bangladesh. From the period of 20 September to 10 October, 1,920 refugees were affected by the monsoon in Cox's Bazar. In that same period, 208 refugees were displaced due to the monsoon. Tropical Cyclone Bulbul's passage on 9-10 November saw 12 fatalities in Bangladesh.

WHO declared Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar as the world's 'largest reservoir' of polio and called for urgent action to boost vaccination. By the end of 2014, 295 polio cases had been recorded, compared to 91 in 2013. The number of infected districts/towns had almost doubled from 22 in 2013 to 40 in 2014. In the period between July 2012 and February 2015, 80 polio workers and those protecting them have been killed whereas 54 received serious injuries. Such brazen attacks against health workers finds no precedent anywhere in the world. Pakistan's polio cases are declining, with just 54 cases of wild polio virus reported in 2015, down more than 80 percent from 2014, when the country experienced a large spike in cases. As of 29 June 2016, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) had confirmed 12 cases of polio in Pakistan in 2016, with the most recent case located in KPk\u2019s Dera Ismail Khan District. During the same week in 2015, the GPEI had confirmed 25 polio cases. The GPEI also reported that no environmental samples have tested positive for polio since May 12 when a team collected a positive sample in Punjab\u2019s Dera Ghazi Khan District. One new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported in early October, from Sujawal, Sindh (south-east of Karachi), with onset of paralysis on 3 September. It is the most recent case in the country, and brings the total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 to 15. In November 2016, a new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported with onset of paralysis on 3 September, from Kohistan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), in the north of the country. It brought the total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 to 16. As well, three new WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported from Balochistan (two from Quetta and one from Killa Abdullah, collected on 20 September, 14 October and 15 October). An additional new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported in Sujawal district in central Sindh, with onset of paralysis on 3 November. It brought the total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 to 17. The majority of the polio cases during the last six months were reported from non-reservoir areas, i.e. from \u2018tier 2, 3 and 4\u2019 districts (districts which are considered to be more vulnerable to polio re-infection or spread). There have been no paralytic cases of wild poliovirus from the traditional polio reservoirs in Pakistan since February 2016. As of 21 December, 19 WPV1 cases were reported in 2016. It is the lowest number of annual cases ever reported, from the fewest number of affected areas in the country. WHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV1 within the common reservoir between Pakistan and Afghanistan to be high (due to the historical spread of such strains across the joint epidemiological block with Afghanistan). One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in Killa Abdullah, Balochistan, with onset of paralysis on 22 December 2016. This brought the total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 to 20. Pakistan continues to implement the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication. The focus is to continue to build immunity against both type 1 and 2 poliovirus, and to address ongoing circulation of both the WPV1 and the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains. As of 7 June 2017, there were two WPV1 cases for 2017. There were 20 cases in 2016. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 13 February, from Diamir district, Gilgit Baltistan. The year 2016 saw the lowest ever annual number of polio cases in the country but poliovirus continues to be isolated through environmental surveillance over a significant geographical range. Efforts are ongoing through implementation of the national emergency action plan to address remaining gaps in coverage and surveillance, in close coordination with neighbouring Afghanistan. Pakistan\u2019s Polio Eradication Programme launched the offensive campaign against the virus. The intense preparations were underway for a special targeted campaign in vulnerable pockets of 73 districts / towns / agencies across the country. The program targeted a total of 10.44 million children under the age of five. One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to three. It was the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on 11 June, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. Meanwhile, the Pakistan and Afghanistan National Emergency Operation Centre teams put together a joint response plan for new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases / isolates in the southern corridor (comprising Quetta Block / Greater Kandahar). No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains three. Six new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, all collected in July, from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan; Gadap, Gulberg, Kamari, greater Karachi, Sindh; Islamabad; and, Rawalpindi, Punjab. Five country-wide vaccination campaigns had been held in Pakistan since October 2016, preparing for the 2017 high season for poliovirus transmission, which ran from June until September. The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) achieved a milestone as it completed a year without reporting a single case of polio. According to a statement issued by FATA Secretariat, the last polio case in Fata was reported on July 27, 2016. In line with the National Emergency Action Plan 2017-18, female vaccination teams are being hired with renewed focus on developing accurate micro plans so that the space for missing a single child is eliminated. Immunisation efforts have in the past been hampered by militants. As of 13 September, the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 was four. The most recent case was reported from Karachi. Meeting of the Provincial Task Force Sindh Province reviewed the situation in Karachi and agreed for an action plan to improve the SIAs quality in Karachi. The first country-wide immunization campaign of the current low season for poliovirus transmission took place from 18-22 September 2017. More than 38 million children under 5 years were vaccinated by a team of 250,000 dedicated frontline workers. According to the independent post-campaign monitoring, the September National Immunization Days (NIDs) have been one of the best campaigns this year, with 96% of children nationally found vaccinated and finger marked. So far this year, the number of polio cases reported in Pakistan is five, including the most recent case from Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported in September 2017. All these cases are being contained through aggressive outbreak responses. Pakistan has launched the first sub-national immunization days (SNIDs) campaign of the current low transmission season on 30 October 2017, targeting more than 21 million children under the age of 5. The campaign has taken place in a total of 95 districts. The current polio epidemiology in the country is best ever observed. The number of wild poliovirus cases has declined from 306 in 2014 to 54 in 2015 and only 20 in 2016. Momentum is maintained in 2017 where the current case count of 5 compares to 18 at same point in time during 2016. In November 2017, three new polio cases were reported, bringing the total national cases count to eight, compared to 19 this time last year. Two of the three new cases were from Baluchistan, and one from Karachi.

Following initial landfall as a Category 3 typhoon in San Policarpo, Eastern Samar, just after noon on 14 May, Typhoon Vongfong (locally named Ambo) continues to bring destructive winds and heavy to intense rainfall as it moves northwest towards mainland Luzon. On 15 May, the eye of the typhoon carried maximum sustained winds of 125 km/h near the center and gustiness of up to 165 km/h making further landfalls in Northern Samar, Masbate and Quezon provinces. The combination of high winds, sustained heavy rainfall and storm surges has impacted vulnerable communities in the Eastern Visayas, Bicol and Southern Luzon which were also heavily affected by Typhoon Kammuri (local name Tisoy) in December 2019. Regional authorities in Bicol report that over 300,000 people sought refuge in some 2,300 evacuation centers across the provinces of Sorsogon, Albay, Catanduanes, Masbate and Camarines Sur.

There have been 184 volcanic earthquakes, 156 rockfall events, and four dome-collapse pyroclastic density current occurrences reported so far. Explosive and effusive activity of the Mayon volcano, located in Bicol Region, central Philippines, is ongoing. In the past 24 hours, two main lava flows moving in southern and south-eastern direction and ash plumes 100 m high have been recorded by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS). According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC), more than 20,200 people are still displaced while almost 38,400 others have been affected across 26 Barangays located in Albay Province (Bicol Region). The current status of Mayon Volcano remains at Alert Level 3, indicating an on-going state of alertness. The volcano continues to exhibit a slow effusion of lava flow, extending to various lengths along different gullies. Specifically, the lava flow reached approximately 3.4 kilometers along Bonga Gully, 1.1 kilometer along Misi Gully, and 1 kilometer along Basud Gully. Additionally, there have been instances of lava collapse occurring up to 4 kilometers from the volcano\u2019s crater.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"The HCT Clusters are actively engaging with government counterparts and are ready to respond should the need arise.

Thus far the outbreak is localized in Tamatave and Faratsiho in Vakinankaratra Region (100km southwest of Antananarivo). By 28 September, there were 104 cases of which 52 were confirmed pneumonic plague with 20 deaths (19.23% case fatality rate).

As of 30 September, 10 cities have reported pneumonic plague cases and the three most affected districts include: the capital city and suburbs of Antananarivo (27 cases, 7 deaths), Toamasina (18 cases, 5 deaths), and Faratshio (13 cases, 1 death). From 1 August to 24 November 2017, a cumulative total of 2,384 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of plague, including 207 deaths (case fatality rate 9%), have been reported from 57 of 114 (50%) districts in Madagascar.

A Cholera Treatment Center (CTC) has been activated in Samba to treat cholera cases (hospital on the outskirts of Moroni). This has been confirmed by the Dar Es Alam Laboratory and reaffirmed by the Comoros Ministry of Health. The spread of cholera is progressing steadily. The first locally transmitted cases appeared on Monday, February 5, 2024. As of February 11, a total of 33 cases were confirmed (13 being treated in the CTC, and two deaths registered from Grande Comores). As of 10 March 2024, cumulative number of cases and deaths are 188 and 7 respectively (CFR=3.7%). In epi week 10, new cases increased by 100% from 23 in the previous week to 46. There was one new death reported epi week 10 compared to no death in the previous week. Cases are now in the three Islands of Grande Comore, Mwali, and Ndzuwani. Grande Comore accounts for about 84% of the cases. The outbreak dynamics and projection may change in the next few weeks with confirmed cases in Ndzuwani which is the most densely populated Island among the three Islands. As of 8 April, 1,187 suspected cases (tested by rapid diagnosis tests) and 22 deaths, have been reported, including 152 new cases including 5 new deaths recorded between 4 and 7 April. UNICEF has reported its concerns regarding the overall lack of financial resources and human capacities, alerting about the 78 cases reported in 2 days in Domoni, the most important port after Mutsamudu on the island of Anjouan. The case fatality rate is 2.5%, above the acceptable WHO threshold (<1%). Most of the deaths happen in communities and can be explained by the overall denial on the part of the population and the inadequate response resources, coverage and access to care. Since the cholera epidemic was declared in Comoros on 2 February 2024, the country has reported 2,319 positive cases and 55 deaths, resulting in a 2.4% case mortality rate. The recent peak occurred last week with 393 cases and 15 deaths. The epidemic's epicentre is currently Anjouan island and the capital Moroni, with cases reported across all three islands and in all 17 health districts. Children and adolescents account for over 40% of reported cases. Efforts to control the outbreak involve 19 Case Area Targeted Interventions (CATI) teams, a collaboration between UNICEF, the Ministry of Health, and the Comorian Red Crescent. However, there are reports of shortages in human resources and supplies. Humanitarian partners are making provisions for a scaled-up response. In Comoros, since the declaration of the outbreak in early February, the number of cholera cases and deaths has continued to rise, with the disease spreading across all three islands (Ngazidja, Ndzuwani, and Mwali). As of 20 May 2024, Comoros reported a total of 6,745 cases and 118 deaths with a case fatality rate of 2.1%. The EU has released EUR 500,000 in emergency funding to respond to the ongoing outbreak. The funding will support UNICEF to address immediate and critical needs in order to prevent the spread and minimise the impact of cholera in the affected areas. Cholera outbreak is ongoing in Comoros since the first case was reported on 2 February 2024. As of 18 June 2024, a cumulative total of 9,467 cases were reported, with the majority of cases reported from Ndzuwani (8,295 cases), followed by Ngazidja (622 cases), and Mwali (550 cases); 142 deaths (CFR 1.5%) are also reported. As of 18 August 2024, 10,342 suspected cases were recorded. Of these, 1,100 (10.6%) cases were confirmed through Rapid Diagnostic Tests, while epidemiological links clinically confirmed 9,242. The outbreak has resulted in 149 deaths, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.4%. Ndzuwani has been the hardest hit by the cholera outbreak, with an attack rate of 236 per 10,000 people, followed by Mwali with 92, and Ngazidja with 14 per 10,000 people. Nearly a month (28 July to 18 August) has elapsed, and no new cholera cases have been reported. The cholera outbreak declared on 2 February 2024 on Ngazidja Island in the Union of Comoros, shows a downward trend after more than six months of response. Three islands were affected.

The Bagre Dam spilled on the 31st of August 2018, when the dam reached its maximum spillage level at 235m on that day. However, by the 10th of September, the dam was still spilling, and water level remained at the maximum level of 235m.

The forecast was materialized during 28 November - 2 December and due to precipitation and snowstorms in the central and eastern provinces during 24-25 November 2022. As of 2 December, in Uvs and Khovd provinces, 216 livestock from 12 households have perished, 2 gers have been completely destroyed, 4 people went missing and 4 found, 2 of them are being hospitalized. NAMEM released the Dzud risk map on 2 December 2022, which indicates that 16 per cent of the Mongolian territory is at the highest level of risk, 43 per cent is at high level of risk of Dzud, 33 per cent is at moderate risk, 10 per cent is at low and the least level of risk. The most soums with high-level risks are located in Bayan-Ulgii, Uvs, Zavkhan, Bayankhongor, Govi-Altia, Uvurkhangai, Bayankhongor, a few soums in Dornogovi, Sukhbaatar and Dundgovi are also identified to be a very high level of risk. According to NAMEM, Dzud index has a high correlation to livestock mortality (1940 - 2015 plot of Dzud index, drought index and livestock, NAMEM), also, the vegetation index plays a major role in the shaping of winter (Trigger update variation, 501). The high temperature and low precipitation caused severe drought in the summer, which is the reason why the livestock couldn't accumulate enough fat to overcome the winter, and the meteorology office stated anomalous low temperatures in late December. As mentioned before due to the drought and economic inflation, meat price has been significantly reduced, therefore decreasing the income of herders. Combined with the severe winter, the herder households are at risk to fail to meet the immediate basic needs. As of 1 February 2023, approximately 70 per cent of Mongolia or a total of 22 Aimags or provinces and 310 Soums or townships, are at either high or extreme Dzud situation. This has directly affected the livelihoods of 191,000 herder households. About 87,000 of these herder households have less than 200 heads of livestock and are considered vulnerable. It is reported that about 416,560 livestock have perished as of early February. Historically, though, the peak of livestock mortality is from February to April. Mongolian herder/pastoralists are heavily reliant on grazing their animals, such as goats, sheep, cattle, horses, yaks and camels, on open rangelands all year round. The availability of sufficient forage is dependent on favorable weather conditions for livestock to have sufficient food during the summer and gain strength to make it through upcoming cold season, as well as for herders to stock hay and fodder for same season. Herders' primary livelihood depends on their livestock, and preventing fatalities is their primary concern. However, in the summer of 2022, Mongolia experienced drought which led to poor pastures and malnourished livestock. The number of livestock entering the winter season also reached an all-time high of 71 million. This means a high number of livestock must be prevented from mortality over the winter season. The winter situation has been intensified by the extreme cold wave in January, where the air temperature reached -50 Celsius in Zavkhan and Uvs province. Meanwhile, in other provinces, the air temperature was colder by 3-4 Celsius than multi-year average, and snow coverage height was 37 cm as highest in the central region and averagely 27 cm in the western region, which prevents livestock from grazing. According to NAMEM data, the percentage of Mongolia's land covered in snow has increased from 14 per cent in October 2022 to 43 per cent in February 2023. The whole country experienced high precipitation starting from early November to early December 2022, major snow storms in middle of January 2023 and more precipitation in late February 2023. In November 2022, the lowest temperature reached -47 Celsius in the night in Zavkhan, Khentii, Khuvsgul, Uvs, provinces, due to prolonged and heavy precipitation, over 70 per cent of the country was covered in high snow reaching 37 cm in central region with average of 21 cm, in western region, the average snow height was 24 cm. In January 2023, the peak of cold wave started from 15 January until the end of January.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"As mentioned before due to the drought and economic inflation, meat price has been significantly reduced, therefore decreasing the income of herders.

Otis is forecast to continue northwestward inland over the central-western Guerrero State on 25-26 October, weakening and becoming a tropical storm. Very heavy rainfall, strong winds and storm surges associated with the passage of Otis, caused floods and landslides that have resulted in evacuations and severe damage. WHO PAHO and national authorities report, as of 26 October, 34,522 evacuated families in 631 temporary shelters across the affected area. The Ministry of Health reports 120 health facilities with some type of damage. Some 80 per cent of hotel infrastructure suffered considerable damage.

There are 58 people reported as missing and 46 deaths have been reported. Additionally, medical care has been provided for 1,248 instances and there were 293 hospital transfers made.

IFRC estimates that a total of 928,252 people were exposed to Hurricane Otis, impacting 848,647 in Acapulco and 79,605 in Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. According to the Guerrero State Attorney General's Office, there are 48 people dead and 26 people still missing. Basic services in Acapulco are being progressively re-established. Two water treatment plants in the municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez have cumulatively supplied 115,900 litres of water. Media reports indicate that the Acapulco Chamber of Commerce, Services and Tourism estimates that 63,000 economic units of tourism services in the city will be affected, representing the loss of approximately 180,000 jobs. Whilst there are no overall cost estimates for the impact of the hurricane available at time of writing, private market insured losses from Hurricane Otis were estimated to be between $2.5bn and $4.5bn. Overall losses are estimated at US$ 12 billion, and insured losses at around US$ 4 billion due to the high concentration of hotels in the city. According to official reports, drinking water services have been re-established in Acapulco and Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. However, UNICEF\u2019s field reports have located peripheral communities with persistent WASH needs. Public lighting service was re-established in Acapulco on 18 December 2023, and in Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez in the second week of January 2024.

Given the lack of precise information on which schools have re-opened and which remain closed, there is no estimate on the number of children remaining out of school. Main humanitarian needs for children persist. Although hospitals and medical units are functioning, gaps on availability of medicines, other medical supplies and staff remain. The prevalence of dengue remains of concern, given the need of more adequate preventive and response interventions. UNICEF's mobile medical unit continues to detect cases of malnutrition among children. In terms of education, a number of schools still have cleaning needs. In those cases, where schools have opened, material is still needed including books, uniforms, furniture, etc. As reported by staff who have visited social assistance centers, concerns remain regarding the psychological impact of the disaster on affected children.

The final death toll, however, could rise - probably to over two thousand but possibly as high as three thousand. Many bodies are still awaiting recovery in the water and on the sand bar of the lagoon. To reduce the health risk, PNG authorities have been burning bodies in mass graves. The Tsunami, caused by an earthquake with the magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter Scale on 17 July, has claimed a heavy death toll.

The number of earthquakes detected in the area of Nyiragongo volcano and the deformation rates have decreased slightly since 29 May 2021. However, seismic activity and ground deformation continue to indicate the presence of magma under the urban area of Goma with an extension under Lake Kivu. An estimated 415,700 people have been displaced across several localities in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and across the border in Rwanda. Authorities and humanitarian organisations are providing help for those most affected. The rehabilitation of the damaged water supply system in Goma is ongoing. The risk of a cholera outbreak remains. Twelve suspected cholera cases were reported in the health centre of Sak\u00e9 between 27 and 29 May. Sak\u00e9 hosts more than 56,000 displaced persons and most suspected cholera cases are among them. It was reported that 288,404 people in Nyiragongo Territory were affected, 32 reported deaths, including 13 people during the evacuation of the city, 14 people burned by the lava and 5 asphyxiated by gases. The DRC North Kivu Branch has received 540 requests for tracing missing children and 40 adults have been reported missing. 1,722 structures have been destroyed, but the number will continue to rise as assessments are completed, and 18km of road cut-off. Following the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano on May 22, Congolese authorities ordered the evacuation of 10 of Goma's 18 neighborhoods. As of June 6, IOM counted more than 400,000 displaced people internally as well as to Rwanda, including 160,000 people who have already returned. Certain businesses and services such as banks are closed and certain markets partially or totally interrupted, which particularly affects the informal sector on which many very poor and poor households depend. Humanitarian actors have provided assistance areas of displacement, but this remains largely insufficient in view of the needs in WASH, shelter and food security in particular. The government recently announced that returns would be organized gradually during the month of June and the various services are expected to reopen in the coming days. 450,000 people were displaced and evacuated after the Nyiragongo volcano eruption. The majority (over 80%) returned to their localities or neighborhoods of origin. 4,051 households are currently living in collective centers and temporary sites. An unknown number are living with host families in Nyiragongo. Over 21,133 of the people displaced in the aftermath of the eruption of the Mount Nyiragongo on 22 May 2021 have now found shelter in 11 schools and two churches in Goma and Nyiragongo and will soon move to temporary sites established by the Military Government. 15,540 individuals remain displaced in collective sites and host families in Masisi, Rutshuru and Minova. The eruption of the Mount Nyiragongo volcano on 22 May 2021 forced more than 364,000 people to flee their homes in Goma and surrounding areas according to OCHA\u2019s estimates. The majority of the people have since returned, but an estimated 5,612 people (1,900 households) remain displaced in Masisi and Rutshuru territories according to UNHCR\u2019s protection monitoring partner INTERSOS. According to joint assessments, led by the local authorities, over 28,500 persons or 4,173 families have been affected by the volcano. Out of this, nearly 20,000 persons (2,901 families) have lost their homes, while almost 900 individuals (130 families) have lost their land and 7,800 persons (1,142 families) have lost the houses that they were renting. Out of this, 2,892 persons with specific needs have been identified, including persons living with a handicap, pregnant women and elderly persons.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Authorities and humanitarian organisations are providing help for those most affected.

In the morning of 13 December, TWENTYEIGHT is forecast to strengthen to a tropical storm, as it continues westwards over the Pacific Ocean, passing south of Sorol. On 15 December, Typhoon Rai (locally named Odette) further intensified and became of typhoon strength while it continued to move west northwestward. According to the Philippines weather bureau, PAGASA, Typhoon Rai continues to gain strength, currently packing maximum winds of 130 km/h and gustiness of up to 160 km/h and is expected to make landfall in the vicinity of Surigao Provinces or southern portion of Eastern Visayas late on Thursday,16 December with high winds up to 155 km/h. The typhoon is forecasted to make landfall in vicinity of CARAGA or Eastern Visayas, then move slightly north westward and cross several provinces in Central and Western Visayas regions before emerging over the Sulu Sea on Friday. Typhoon Rai\u2019s sustained winds may reach its peak intensity of 155 km/h before landfall. Areas along the typhoon\u2019s track will experience torrential to intense rains and strong gale winds with is a high risk of wind damage, rain-induced landslides, flash floods and flooding, particularly in areas that experienced significant antecedent rainfall earlier in December. The government pre-emptively evacuated over 330,000 people in Northeastern Mindanao and Visayas ahead of a potentially devasting impact of the Super Typhoon Rai/Odette. Needs assessments ongoing but hampered by flooded and blocked roads and interruption of other lifelines. According to the initial reports of the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC) and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), over 330,000 people have been pre-emptively evacuated, 674 evacuation centers are open and as of now one 1 death and 2 injured are reported. The onslaught of a typhoon cut essential lifelines, leaving 63 cities and municipalities without electricity, affecting 73 seaports and cancelling over 160 domestic and international flights. Typhoon Rai made initial landfall in Siargao Island, province of Surigao del Norte in Caraga region, northern Mindanao on 16 December 2021. It carried gusts up to 270 km/h with maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h near the centre making it the strongest storm to make landfall in the Philippines this year. The trail of the Typhoon Rai crossed the Philippine archipelago from Caraga to Eastern and Central Visayas and Palawan. The latest government figures indicate 130,128 families or 477,614 people affected in 1,417 barangays in Regions V, VI, VII, VIII, X, XI, Caraga and MIMAROPA. Due to power disruptions and intermittent signals, it has been challenging to obtain further details from the ground. Hence, these reported numbers are expected to increase significantly. Pre-emptively 332,855 people were evacuated, and 1,603 evacuation centres hosted 77,494 families (289,049 individuals).

On 2 September at 3.00 UTC, its centre was over Grand Bahama Island with maximum sustained winds of 285 km/h. Parts of Marsh Harbour are flooded, and power and water outages reported. Unconfirmed media reports from Abaco indicate badly damaged roofing and downed power lines, with some roads all but impassable. Flooding in Abaco is believed to have contaminated wells with saltwater. Data from the Pacific Disaster Center shows a potential need of 222,000 liters of water per day. North Abaco Minister of Parliament Darren Henfield reports that Abaco has suffered catastrophic damage and that there are casualties which have yet to be confirmed. Unconfirmed media reports also say that the Power and Light office in Abaco was flattened. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) indicates that there are reports of massive flooding in Grand Bahama as well. The Grand Bahama International Airport is said to be underwater. The Bahamian Defense Force was dispatched to rescue people in East Grand Bahama. Dorian cleared Grand Bahama on 3 September, allowing teams in Bahamas to perform aerial reconnaissance and begin assessing the scope of the damage. Initial reports show severe widespread damage to housing and infrastructure across both Abaco and Grand Bahama. Bahamas is reporting at least seven deaths so far and are expecting this number to rise. Preliminary information on needs suggests that more than 60,000 people may need water and food assistance \u2013 further assessments are still pending. International organizations are making additional deployments of personnel and resources to support the Government and NEMA.

On 5 September at 3.00 UTC, its centre was 155 km east of Georgia's central coast, with maximum sustained winds of 185 km/h (Category 3 hurricane). Heavy rain, strong winds and storm surge are affecting the coast of central Florida, north and central South Carolina. At least 20 fatalities have been reported in the Bahamas, 17 in the Abacos and 3 in Grand Bahama. According to WFP, more than 76,000 people were affected and are in need of immediate humanitarian relief. Power outages have been reported across Florida's east coast. The number of fatalities following Tropical Cyclone DORIAN's passage in The Bahamas has reached 45, including 37 in Abaco and 8 in Grand Bahama. Most Abaco residents have evacuated to New Providence Island, while shelters in Nassau City are at maximum capacity, as reported by U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. Various government authorities and humanitarian partners are assisting the affected population with food and relief kits. The EU Civil Protection Mechanism was activated on 4 September following a request from the Bahamian government and relief, logistics and communications support are being sent by The Netherlands and Luxembourg. One week after initial landfall, the official death toll from Hurricane Dorian stands at 50 in Abaco and Grand Bahama Islands. Thousands still remain missing. An estimated 90 percent of housing and infrastructure on Abaco Island is damaged or destroyed, with many homes still without power. An estimated 5,000 people have been evacuated by government, military, and private boats and aircraft.

There were some minor landslides following the earthquake, but as of 26 February no damage to infrastructure or homes has been reported. At 15.17 UTC on 26 February 2018, a major aftershock with a magnitude of 6.2 M occurred in the Southern Highlands province close to the location of the 7.5 M earthquake of 25 February.

The Government, private companies and humanitarian partners have focused initial relief efforts on communities in the worst-hit seven LLGs in Hela and Southern Highlands provinces. Private companies and bilateral partners, including Australia, Japan and New Zealand, play a critical role in the early phase of the response. They work closely with UN agencies, NGOs, CSO, FBOs and the Red Cross. Humanitarian partners have provided food to over 34,400 people in Nipa Kutubu LLG and Komo Magarima LLG. Up to 54,260 households are estimated to be in need of emergency shelter. To date, 100 households in Mount Bosavi LLG and another 100 households in Para/Moro have received shelter equipment. On 27 March 2018, the Parliament passed two bills formalizing the State of Emergency in earthquake-affected areas and establishing a Restoration Authority for the affected provinces. The Disaster Management Team (DMT) issued its initial earthquake response plan, which focuses on providing life-saving assistance and helping to re-establish basic services for 270,000 people in need of immediate assistance due to the 26 February 2018 earthquake and subsequent aftershocks and landslides. It calls for US$ 62 million to support urgent action in seven areas, including Food Security; Health and Nutrition; Water, Sanitation and Hygiene; Shelter; Protection; Education; and Logistics Coordination. US$ 43 million has been mobilized from the private sector for earthquake response and recovery, primarily as contributions to government efforts. Due to restricted humanitarian access, an operational planning group for land-based relief activities in Hela province was established on 16 May.

On the forecast track, TRAMI is expected to continue moving northwestward further strengthening and to make landfall over the eastern Cagayan Valley region, northern Luzon island on 23 October very early in the afternoon (UTC), with maximum sustained winds of 93 km/h (tropical storm). Tropical storm TRAMI (named Kristine in the Philippines), is moving north-westwards and is approaching the north-eastern coasts of Luzon, northern Philippines. On 23 October at 3.00 UTC its centre was located over the sea, approximately 200 km east of Casiguran, Aurora province, Central Luzon region with maximum sustained winds of 85 km/h (tropical storm) and gusts up to 105 km/h. Following its influence over at least four regions of the Philippines, national authorities report three missing people and one injured person in the Bicol region. In addition, more than 12,600 have been displaced and more than 382,000 affected across Bicol, Western Visayas, Eastern Visayas, and Zamboanga Peninsula. TRAMI is forecast to make landfall in an area between the eastern coasts of Cagayan Valley, and Central Luzon on 23 October late morning. After that, it will cross northern Luzon and it will continue westwards over the South China Sea moving towards central-eastern Vietnam in the next few days. Tropical storm TRAMI (named Kristine in the Philippines) made landfall over the eastern coast of Cagayan Valley, north-eastern Luzon in the afternoon of 23 October. On 24 October at 3.00 UTC, its centre was located inland in the vicinity of Aguinaldo municipality, Ifugao Province, Cordillera Administrative Region region, northern Philippines with maximum sustained winds of 95 km/h (tropical storm) and gusts up to 115 km/h. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reports, as of 25 October, 13 fatalities, seven people still missing, and five injured across five regions. NDRRMC also reports nearly 319,700 displaced and a total of approximately 2,656,500 affected people across most of the Luzon island. Tropical cyclone TRAMI (\\\"Kristine\\\" in the Philippines) continued moving westward over the South China Sea on 25-27 October, further weakening but remaining a tropical storm. On 28 October after 0.00 UTC it made landfall over the Da Nang city area (central Viet Nam), with maximum sustained winds of 83 km/h. On 28 October at 0.00 UTC its centre was located inland over the central Quang Nam Province (central Viet Nam), with maximum sustained winds of 56 km/h (tropical depression). In the Philippines, its passage over Luzon, Visayas and northern Mindanao caused very heavy rainfall, floods and landslides. NDRRMC reports, as of 28 October, 97 fatalities, 30 people still missing, 69 injured people, 6.7 million affected and over 980,000 displaced people. In central Viet Nam, ADINet reports one person still missing, four injured people, nearly 62,000 affected people, and around 15,500 damaged houses. On the forecast track, TRAMI is expected to continue moving eastward, re-entering in the South China Sea on 28-29 October, further weakening and dissipating. Tropical cyclone TRAMI is dissipating over the South China Sea after it made landfall over eastern Quang Nam province (eastern-central Vietnam) on 27 October. According to the ASEAN Disaster Information Network (ADINet), in Vietnam, one person died and another is still missing in Quang Binh province while five people have been injured across the provinces of Quang Tri and Quang Nam. Moreover, more than 138,000 people have been affected as well as 34,519 houses. Its passage over the Philippines on 23-24 October, resulted in 111 fatalities, 74 injured people and 30 still missing. In addition, a total of 7,134,954 people have been affected and almost 1,000,000 displaced across most regions of the country. In the Philippines, Tropical Storm Kristine (local name) has caused devastating impacts across 17 regions. Approximately 7.1 million people were affected and 935,114 individuals displaced. 83,777 houses were damaged and more than 61,746 hectares of crops washed away, which severely affected transportation and communication networks. As of October, it was the deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines in 2024. According to the Department of Education, PHP 3.3 billion worth of infrastructure was damaged in more than 38,000 schools. More than 7.9m people (2m families) have been affected across 17 out of 18 regions in the Philippines. Around 684.9k have been displaced, of which 250.6k people are in evacuation centres (EC) and 434.3k temporarily staying elsewhere. The number of casualties has risen with 141 reported deaths, 86 injured, and 21 missing. Clean up and recovery efforts are ongoing in areas where flood waters have started to recede, and people have started to return to their houses. According to ADINet, in Viet Nam, five people died in Quang Binh province and five others were injured (four in Quang Nam and one in Quang Tri). Moreover, 143,424 people have been affected and 318 houses damaged. In China, seven people died and another person is still missing across Hainan island. While STS Trami was exiting the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), Tropical Cyclone Kong-rey (local name Leon), which intensified into a super typhoon, passed near the eastern seaboard of the country. The combined number of people affected by STS Trami and STY Kong-rey exceeded 8.8 million (about 2.25 million families). More than 711k people are still displaced, of which 194k people are in evacuation centres. Most of the displaced population is in Region 5, particularly in Camarines Sur and Albay Provinces, where the massive flooding occurred. The number of casualties have reportedly increased from the last reporting period; 151 reported deaths, 134 injured, and 21 missing. One of the hardest hit sectors is agriculture, with 111,411 farmers and fisherfolks affected. The estimated cost of damage to agriculture has reached over US$ 102 million (or PHP 6 billion). In the Philippines, regions affected by Typhoon Kristine, including Region 2 (Cagayan Valley), Region 3 (Central Luzon) are facing issues like open defecation, uncollected trash, and outbreaks of diarrhea and measles. Despite pre-emptive evacuations helping reduce losses, the government\u2019s water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) supplies were insufficient. As of 2 December, 3,300 households affected by STS Kristine in Libon, Albay and Camarines Sur (Milaor, Baao, Magarao and Bombon) received hygiene and water kits. Over 47,544 people, or 11,599 families, remain displaced across 10 regions due to the combined effects of Severe Tropical Storm (STS) Kristine and Super Typhoon (STY) Leon. Damaged houses increased to 326,562, of which 30,941 were totally damaged (destroyed) and 295,561 partially damaged (repairable).

The report highlighted a significant decline in crop yields, with a drop from 206,572 tons harvested in 2021/22 to 125,184 tons in 2022/23. Cereal production in 2022/23 reached only 67,530 tons, which is equivalent to just 23% of the national requirement. The 2022/23 cropping season experienced low and highly erratic rainfall, along with extended dry periods, severely impacting food and agricultural production, disrupting urban water supplies, and damaging the rural economy and socio-cultural structures. As a result, the nation is experiencing significant chronic food insecurity, with over 10% of the population facing food and nutrition problems. The country has experienced dry spells and rainfall deficits in recent years, leading the government to declare a drought emergency in July 2023. This marks the third consecutive year of severe drought, affecting arable agricultural land in a context where 70% of the rural population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, primarily through rain-fed farming. Since then, 163,000 people have been categorized as food insecure. The SADC Synthesis Report on The State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa indicated that 37,000 individuals in Botswana are experiencing food insecurity in 2024. The El Ni\u00f1o drought effect in Southern Africa has further exacerbated the already critical drought situation.

Against the backdrop of scarce rains, over 331,000 households have already registered for the government-funded drought relief programme to assist the affected communities. This programme amounts to EUR 40 million but it currently has a funding gap of EUR 25 million. At the extraordinary summit held on 20 May by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to discuss the El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought and floods affecting member states, the Namibian President called for assistance from SADC countries and the International Community at large to bridge the above-mentioned funding gap. Between April and June 2024, an estimated 1.2 million people (40 percent of the analysed population) in Namibia face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent action to reduce food gaps and protect livelihoods. These are the most vulnerable groups (unemployed, marginalized communities, those with no national documents to benefit from social safety nets, children under the age of five, pregnant and breastfeeding women and pensioners) in both urban and rural areas. This number has more than doubled from 491,000 people (19 percent of the population analysed) which were projected to be facing acute food insecurity during the period under review in the July 2023 analysis. The entire country (all 14 regions) is classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and need action for livelihood protection. Namibia\u2019s deteriorating food security is mainly driven by the impact of El Nino on crop and livestock production, climatic shocks, price shocks, economic decline and unemployment. During the current period of analysis, from July to September 2024, 1.15 million people in Namibia (38 percent of the analysed population) face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent action to reduce food gaps and protect livelihoods; all the 14 areas of analysis are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). This represents an improvement compared to what was projected in the last July 2023 analysis, where 1.44 million people (48 percent) were expected to face high levels of food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) for the same period (July-September 2024). While the main assumption on the impact of El Nino was adjusted, the deterioration of the food security situation is still linked to the negative impact of El Nino on crop and livestock production, price shocks, economic decline and unemployment. In the first projection period (October 2024 \u2013 March 2025), the food security situation is expected to worsen due to the start of the lean season, and seasonal price increases, where 1.26 million people (41 percent of the analysed population) are expected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above.\",\n        \"interventions\": \"Over 331,000 households have registered for the government-funded drought relief programme to assist the affected communities.

Reduced rainfall since January 2017 (30 to 80 per cent decrease compared to average) has been affecting agricultural crop production over an estimated 50,000 hectares of land. Affected areas have reported that yields of some crops are expected to decrease between to 30 to 50 percent compared to last year. On 27 June, UN agencies, IFRC and INGO members travelled to South Hwanghae province together with authorities to assess the impact of the drought. Many reservoirs, which are a critical source for communities\u2019 water supply and irrigation, are reportedly well below capacity and in some communities, water is reportedly being trucked in from other areas. DPR Korea's crop production for 2017, including staple rice, maize, potatoes and soybean, has been severely damaged by prolonged dry weather conditions, threatening food security for a large part of its population. Although rains in the first half of July provided some relief, they were generally too late to allow normal planting and development of the 2017 main season crops, to be harvested in October-November. The lack of rain is expected to have a serious impact on main season crops in the major cereal producing areas, including the provinces of South and North Pyongan, South and North Hwanghae and Nampo City, which normally account for close to two-thirds of overall main season cereal production. With forecasts of reduced production of the 2017 main season crop, the food security situation is expected to further deteriorate during the 2017/18 marketing year and cereal import requirements are likely to increase. According to Government data and FAO satellite analysis, around 30% of early crops have been lost due to the dry spell that has struck the country. These crops constitute 10% of the overall harvest. Rain began this month which is important for the main crops, but given the reliance on agriculture any loss has negative impact on vulnerable communities\u2019 food security and nutrition. As in previous years, the dry spell coincided with the lean period and as a consequence, government rations, of which 70% of the population rely, recently dropped to 300 grams per person per day from 400g, which is still well below the target 573g.
