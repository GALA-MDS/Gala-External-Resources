Due to the limited availability of vaccines and medical equipment, a difficulty which was further amplified by COVID-19, the vaccination campaign was planned in two phases: a first phase in February and March covered the 13 most affected health districts and a second phase followed in August in the remaining 22 health districts. After an initial phase between January and March, where measles cases continued to increase, a decrease was observed in the 13 health districts that had already implemented the immunization campaign.

These numbers are likely to increase as rescue teams continue to search for survivors. The explosions have caused widespread damage to residential buildings. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation has called for international support describing the situation as catastrophic. Medical and WASH support is urgently needed including mobile hospitals, medical and WASH equipment, and medicines. Temporary shelter, food assistance and psychological support for victims are also critical. A series of explosions on Sunday in Equatorial Guinea is now known to have killed 31 people, officials say. The number of those injured rose to 600. The blasts hit a military base in the country’s main city, Bata. Officials blame badly stored dynamite along with stubble burning by nearby farmers. Teams including volunteers continue to search the wreckage of buildings and homes for victims. There are fears the death toll could rise further as some victims may still be trapped. In a statement, President Obiang Nguema said the blasts had been caused “by the negligence of a unit charged with the care and protection of stores of dynamite and explosives” at the Nkoantoma military base. He said the base had “caught fire due to neighbouring farmers clearing farming land by setting it alight, leading to the explosion”. The president has appealed for international aid. The National Red Cross Society’s initial assessments identified at least 3,900 people (780 households) as directly affected, including 400 households (2,000 people) in Nkuantoma Military Camp, 100 households (500 people) in Mondong, 150 households (750 people) in Razel and 130 households (650 people) in Nkuantoma neighbourhood. This figure was corroborated by satellite imagery from UNOSAT issued on 13 March indicating that some 603 structures were damaged, 238 of which were destroyed and 365 severely or moderately damaged. Many people living within the vicinity of the military camps were able to return to their homes 72 hours after the explosions.

As of 19 November, the government has reported 7 fatalities, 30 injuries, and 2 missing, reflecting the level of preparedness measures despite the strength of the storm. Most affected areas were still in the recovery phase from prior cyclones, compounding the challenges faced by affected communities. Man-yi is the sixth cyclone to traverse the Philippines in one month, has now weakened to a severe tropical storm and poses no further threat. The last three tropical cyclones (Toraji, Usagi and Man-yi) have affected more than 1.8 million individuals, equating to approximately 495,788 families across Regions 1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B and 5. Areas like Caramoan, Garchitorena, Lagonoy, San Jose, Sangay, and Siruma in Camarines Sur and Northern Catanduanes are among the hardest hit by Pepito, with urgent WASH needs identified in initial assessments. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reports nearly 361,400 evacuated people — 244,500 in 1,913 evacuation centres — and a total of nearly 3,967,000 affected people due to the combined effects of the three typhoons (Toraji, Usagi and Man-Yi). The Philippines\\' Department of Health reported 93 casualties (13 deaths, 80 injuries) from Typhoon Nika, Tropical Storm Ofel, and Super Typhoon Man-Yi/Pepito in addition to the 249 from Typhoon Leon and Severe Tropical Storm Kristine. UNICEF reported 12 million learners with classes disrupted and 167,122 learning materials damaged by Nika, Ofel, and Man-Yi/Pepito. Tropical cyclones Marce, Nika, Ofel and Pepito (Man-Yi) displaced more than 10,900 people, or 3,112 families, in seven regions, many of them in northern Luzon. According to the Department of Agriculture (DA) Bulletin 11, the combined effects of the three cyclones alone have clearly impacted the main agriculture commodities, namely rice, corn, high value crops, livestock, fisheries and agri-facilities amounting to $13.4 million (PHP785.68 million), affecting at least 34,111 farmers and fisherfolk with approximately 41,078 hectares of agriculture areas and estimated production loss of 30,366 metric tons.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"More than 719,000 people were preemptively evacuated.

The Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal (NDRR), reports at least 15 fatalities and five missing people, during the period from 18 June to 2 July. At least 25 people have been injured and 81 families affected. Damage has been reported to 19 houses. On 2-3 June, heavy to very heavy rain with thunderstorms is forecast over central and eastern Nepal, particularly over Province 1, Province 2, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province. Monsoon rainfall continues to have a localized impact. Search and rescue works are predominantly being carried out by federal government agencies. Total monsoon impacts across the country include: 783 displaced families sheltering in various public buildings, significantly increasing COVID-19 transmission risks, 25 deaths, 22 people missing and 1,153 affected families according to Ministry of Home Affairs and Initial Rapid Assessments. Heavy rain continues to affect most Districts of Nepal, causing floods, triggering landslides and leading to an increasing number of deaths and damage. The Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal reports 39 landslides and 16 flood events in the country over the past week. According to media reports, a total of 38 people have died, 24 are still missing and 51 have been injured. At least 1,250 people have been evacuated, 5,100 displaced and a total of 790 houses have been flooded. Light to moderate rain is forecast over most parts of the country on 7-8 July. The monsoon rain continues to affect most parts of Nepal, causing floods, triggering landslides, and resulting in an increasing number of casualties and damage. Over the last 7 days, 26 landslides and nine flood events have occurred in the country. According to national authorities and media reports, more than 50 people have died and almost 410 families have been affected. Monsoon rainfall continues to have a localized impact. Total monsoon impacts across the country include: 783 displaced families sheltering in various public buildings, significantly increasing COVID-19 transmission risks, 58 deaths, 34 people missing and 3,150 affected families according to Ministry of Home Affairs and Initial Rapid Assessments. Damages to the roads and trails particularly in the remote location of Darchula, Manang and northern Gorkha has posed challenges in transportation of relief materials. Monsoon rains have been light over 17-30 July, but to date monsoon related incidence have impacted 47 districts across the country. Displaced families are sheltering in various public buildings, increasing COVID-19 transmission risks and also posing challenges to meeting their basic needs. Flooding and landslide have caused damage to public and private infrastructures, including private houses. Road blockage, damages to the bridges along the road due to the flooding and landslide has posed logistics challenges in reaching out to the affected population. Since 20 August, heavy rain has been affecting various parts of Nepal, causing floods and landslides and resulting in casualties. According to the Nepal National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (DRR), at least 11 people have died, one is missing and up to 27 individuals have been injured. Damage has been reported to 89 houses and 177 families have been affected by floods or landslides. On 30-31 August, light to moderate rain is forecast over most of Nepal and locally heavy rain is expected over western and central Provinces, particularly in Bagmati Province, Gandaki, Lumbini and Sudur Pashchim Provinces. Floods and a landslide event occurred on 30 August in Darchula District (Sudurpashchim Province, far western Nepal), leading to fatalities. According to the Nepal National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (DRR) and media reports, three people died and two are missing. Several houses, buildings, two hydropower plants and five bridges have been damaged or destroyed. The monsoon rains that began in the last week of June have triggered flooding and landslides in many parts of the country, affecting around 10,000 families in 56 out of the country’s 77 districts. On 26 August, rainfall intensified for at least four consecutive days, with many rivers crossing warning levels, causing widespread inundation in many parts of the southern plains and reported incidents of landslides in the hilly region. As a result of this incessant rainfall, 11 districts (Myagdi, Rupandehi, Dang, Darchula, Sindhuli, Nawalparasi East, Nawalparasi West, Kanchanpur, Kailali, Udayapur and Mahottari) and 4,899 families were affected, including 2,129 who were temporarily displaced. In addition, government authorities have reported seven deaths and one missing person in recent days (as of 31 August 2021), while further assessment processes are underway. Many houses have been destroyed by the landslides and floods in specific pocket areas of several districts, and many displaced families are staying with relatives, while others have sought refuge in nearby schools and other temporary shelters. Similarly, displaced families have lost access to water points and sanitation facilities, increasing the risk of health problems, water-borne diseases, and the spread of COVID-19 infection in the community. With 35,591 active cases in the country, there is a high chance of COVID-19 transmission among people affected by the flood and landslide (daily infection rate is still around 20 per cent) either among those staying in home isolation or – most importantly – among those staying in evacuation centres. Severe weather including heavy rain and thunderstorms continues to affect parts of Nepal, causing floods and landslides and leading to casualties. The Nepal National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (DRR) reports that between 2-6 September, 13 people have died in Bagmati, Lumbini and Gandaki Provinces in central Nepal. More than ten individuals have been injured and one person is missing in Lumbini Province. Unusually heavy rainfall in a short period of time on September 6 has led to flooding in the city of Kathmandu, inundating more than 382 houses and several roads, local marketplaces, and parks. About 105 mm of rainfall was recorded in just three hours in Kathmandu. At least 138 people have been rescued by security forces. The most affected households are those living in informal settlements in low-lying areas of the city. The Bagmati River that flows through the city was at danger level, but the water level has receded. This follows heavy rainfall and floods in several areas across the Tarai Valley the previous week, which resulted in nine deaths, four missing people, five injured, and 756 people evacuated, with at least 42 houses completely damaged. Flash floods, floods and landslides caused by heavy rain have been affecting different parts of Nepal, leading to casualties. According to the latest report by NDRRMA, there are 32 dead and 43 missing people. Several Districts in Sudurpaschim Province (western Nepal) have been heavily affected, including Kanchanpur District, where the overflow of Mahakali River flooded several settlements, displacing more than 2,600 people. There has been extensive damage of the paddy crops which were ready to be harvested. Highways have been blocked by landslides in many places of the country. In the eastern parts of the country, two airports operations have been disrupted. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, however rescue efforts are hindered by severe weather conditions and the remoteness of the affected areas. In Nepal, based on the last Disaster Risk Reduction Portal (DRRP), there are 88 fatalities, 30 people still missing and 10 injured people across several Districts. On 21 October, the Prime Minister along with other ministers visited to the affected districts in the western region of the country. The local authorities provide the government relief assistance, that was announced on 20 October, directly to the affected households. Unseasonal heavy rains since 17 October brought floods and landslides across the country and have killed over 100 people. Heavy rains and floods have reportedly damaged rice paddy crops worth more than US$50 million. Roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure were also damaged. The impact of the floods, combined with existing livelihood setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a devastating impact on many communities in Nepal in the coming months. The impact of evacuations, collective sheltering, and rescue operations on COVID-19 transmission rates will be monitored over the coming weeks. According to the data of the Ministry of Home Affairs, between June to 27 October 2021, 673 people have lost their lives, 69 people are missing and 181 people are injured due to the water-induced disaster. Beyond the shelter and displacement related needs, the main impact for affected householders is on their livelihoods since this unforeseen recent rainfall happened during the end of the festival time and as the harvesting of crops was about to start. In some areas, between 60 to 80 per cent of the harvest was lost as per government preliminary data. According to a WFP 72h assessment report released on 28 October, it is estimated that the food security status of 77,635 people is significantly affected as a result of the flooding, of which 63,897 people, or 11,716 households, need immediate assistance.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"Search and rescue works are predominantly being carried out by federal government agencies.

Earlier this year, an EVD outbreak affected North Kivu Province which was declared over on 3 May 2021. Ebola vaccination began today in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s North Kivu Province where a case was confirmed on 8 October. People at high risk, including contacts of the confirmed case and first responders will receive the doses as the health authorities move to curb the spread of the virus. A total of five cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been confirmed in North Kivu province since 8 October 2021. Three people died and all cases are from a community in the Beni health zone. Ten patients are hospitalised, including two confirmed and eight suspected cases. 386 contacts have been established so far, with 322 followed in the last 24 hours and 140 people have been vaccinated so far. The index case, diagnosed on 8 October and deceased in a health facility, had three family members who died in September, but they were not investigated for Ebola. The detected Ebola strain is 96% similar to the one from the 10th EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2018-20). As of 24 October, six cases have been confirmed, the last case was reported on 22 October. All the cases have been from the Health Area of Butsili, Beni Health Zone: 4 people have died, and 2 people are currently in isolation at the temporary Ebola Treatment Center in the General Reference Hospital in Beni. Preliminary sequencing conducted indicates that this outbreak is likely linked to the 2018-2020 Nord Kivu/Ituri Ebola outbreak and was initiated by transmission from a persistently infected survivor or a survivor who experienced relapse. As of 31 October 2021, eight cases (5 female and 3 male) have been confirmed, the last case reported on 30 October 2021. Three Health Areas Butsili, Ngilinga, and Bundji have now reported cases, all of which within the Beni Health Zone. 6 people have died, 1 has tested negative and 1 currently still under treatment at the temporary Ebola Treatment Center in the General Reference Hospital in Beni. No new case of the Ebola virus disease has been recorded in the Beni Health Zone in North Kivu province in the past 16 days, the last confirmed case being on 30 October. The health response to the Ebola outbreak is currently focusing on community surveillance, which remains a major challenge with the low number of community alerts. The Ebola outbreak that erupted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s North Kivu Province in October – the second in 2021 – was today declared over, the national health authorities announced after no new cases were reported at the end of a 42-day countdown, or two incubation periods after the last confirmed case was discharged. In total, 11 cases (eight confirmed, three probable), including six deaths were reported in the outbreak that was declared on 8 October after a new case was confirmed in Beni health zone in the country’s North Kivu Province.

Based on initial reports and assessments, the provinces where most damage has been reported are Faryab province in the Northern region, Nangarhar province in the Eastern region, and Daikundi province in the Central Highlands region. This is the third time that the Northern region has experienced flooding in less than a month, with seven people killed and 384 families affected in heavy rains that occurred on 21 and 26-27 March. As of 30 March, there have been no reports of displacement due to the floods. The health facility in the Kamgal area suffered damage due to a landslide, impacting local access to essential health services. In Kunar, the primary route between Wama and Parun was temporarily obstructed on March 30 by rockslides, disrupting transportation and relief access. Similarly, in Nuristan, the Neshagram village road to Waygal district has been blocked due to landslides, severing the connection of approximately 1,000 to 2,000 families with essential services and the district center. Between 10 and 16 April 2024, Afghanistan experienced heavy rains and flash floods across the central, central highlands, northern, northeastern, southern and western regions. Preliminary reports indicate that almost 1,590 families have been affected, with 35 people killed and another 47 people injured, while 46 families have been displaced. The most severely affected provinces that had fatalities were Badghis (4), Farah (2), Hilmand (5), Kabul (3), Kandahar (4), Laghman (2), Nangahar (1), Parwan (2) and Uruzgan (12). Additionally, more than 930 houses have been destroyed (198) or damaged (738), along with around 63,700 acres of agricultural land and at least 470 livestock reportedly killed. A new wave of rains is expected in the central, south, southeast and southwest regions of the country over the next week, with up to 30 mm of rainfall daily. These volumes are of concern because water reserves are filled to capacity, thus flooding is to be anticipated. The humanitarian impact continues to rise following heavy rainfall and floods that have been affecting several provinces of Afghanistan, particularly Badghis, Uruzgan, Farah, Paktia, Zabul, Helmand, Kunar, Kabul, Badakhshan, Ghor, Kandahar, Takhar, Parwan, Herat, Ghazni, Laghman, Nimroz, and Sar-e-Pol. As of 23 April, media report at least 90 fatalities, and dozens of injured people. In addition, more than 2,000 houses have been damaged, and thousands of livestock have died across the country. On 10 and 11 May, heavy rainfall and flash floods struck northeastern Afghanistan, affecting 21 districts across Badakhshan (5), Baghlan (10) and Takhar (6) provinces. Initial reports indicate 180 fatalities and more than 240 injuries across the three provinces. 8,975 homes were either destroyed or damaged leaving thousands without shelter. In addition to damage and destruction to roads, bridges, and public schools, 11 health facilities across Baghlan and Takhar provinces have been affected disrupting health and nutrition services, and 4,260 livestock have been lost. Heavy rainfall in central Afghanistan has caused a new wave of flash floods on the 17 May 2024. This is while the country still reeling from last week\\'s devastating floods. The newly affected provinces are Ghor, Faryad, Sar-e Pul, Samangan, Balkh and Badghis. On 17 and 18 May, heavy rainfall led to flash floods in the Northern and Western regions of Afghanistan, impacting 10 districts in Ghor province (Charsada, Dawlatyar, Dolayna, Ferozkoh, Lal Wa Sarjangal, Murghab, Pasaband, Saghar, Shahrak, and Tolak districts), as well as eight districts in Faryab province (Almar, Bilcheragh, Chehlgazi, Dawlatabad, Khaibar, Maimana, Pashtun Kot and Qaysar districts). While assessments are ongoing for both provinces, initial reports indicate the large-scale floods have resulted in the deaths of at least 120 people with hundreds more people missing and extensive damage to private properties and civilian infrastructure. Humanitarian partners and local authorities anticipate the number of casualties will increase significantly as search and rescue efforts continue amid reports that people may be trapped under collapsed buildings. In northern Afghanistan, the initial flooding on 17 May in Faryab province reportedly affected around 560 households followed by a second wave of flooding on 18 May which affected approximately 1,300 households across eight districts. Humanitarian partners are ramping up response efforts following 10 and 11 May heavy rainfall and flash floods in Baghlan, Badakhshan and Takhar provinces that affected more than 60,000 people. Across the region to date, approximately 7,800 homes have been confirmed as either destroyed or damaged leaving over 5,000 families displaced according to the Afghan Ministry of Refugee and Repatriation (MoRR). Across the three provinces, MoRR reported 347 people were killed and 1,651 injured due to floods. To date, 225 people have been confirmed killed (137 in the northeastern, 80 in the northern and eight in the western region); more than half of the deaths occurred in Baghlan Province alone. A further 217 people have been wounded. So far in 2024, more than 119,160 people have been affected by heavy rainfall and flash flooding across 32 provinces. On 23 June, two landslides occurred in Paktia province in eastern Afghanistan, one in Orgor village in Saskani district and another in Wazi Zadran, causing casualties and damage. According to media reports, as of 25 June, a total of 12 people died, of whom seven in Orgor village and five in Wazi Zadran district. Flash floods were reported in Guzargah district of Baghlan Province on 27 June, affecting two villages and destroying/damaging an estimated 150 homes, underscoring pervasive vulnerability to floods in this region. Access has been largely restored across affected areas, however the recent flash flood on 27 June has rendered some areas unreachable by responding agencies. Similarly, some areas in the Western region continue to remain inaccessible due to road conditions. Widespread damage to public infrastructure continues to be reported, including to roads, health centers, water networks, and education facilities. Moreover, more than 2,200 acres of land have been damaged in the Western region, while over 5,500 individuals supporting their families have lost access to livelihoods in the Northern and Northeastern regions. On 15 July, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms affected eastern Afghanistan, particularly Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, causing flash floods and leading to casualties and damage. According to media, at least 35 people died while 350 others were injured in Nangarhar province. In the neighbouring Kunar province, five people died following floods in Asadabad city and in Asmar district. The humanitarian impact is increasing following the flash flood events that affected the eastern provinces of Nangarhar, Kunar, and Laghman. According to Save the Children and media, the death toll reached 40 people while 350 others have been injured. In addition, 1,500 children have been displaced and 400 houses have been destroyed. Infrastructure damage has been also reported to telecommunications networks and several roads have also been blocked, making it difficult to access affected areas. To date, the number of reported casualties has increased to 58 fatalities and 380 injured. So far, joint assessment teams (JATs) have assessed 1,925 affected families across Nangarhar, Kunar, and Laghman provinces; further assessments are ongoing. The number of tents destroyed in the Omari camp near the reception center at the Torkham border crossing point has increased from 400 to 550. Severe damage has also been sustained to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities. On 20 August 2024, heavy rains triggered flash floods which swept through Panjshir, Parwan, Kabul, Nangarhar and Kunar province in the eastern and central regions of Afghanistan. The incident affected a total of 1,006 families comprising 6,589 individuals, especially in Jalalabad and Kabul where the highest number of affected populations and damaged shelters were reported. Since early April, preliminary data compiled by the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) indicates that approximately 40,500 homes have been affected, along with substantial loss of life and injuries reported in various provinces. Provinces such as Baghlan, Ghor, and Helmand have experienced particularly high numbers of fatalities and injuries, with the total death toll in the region reaching at least 300. While Ghor and Helmand reported significant injuries, other provinces, including Panjsher, Kapisa, Bamyan, Nimroz, Paktya, and Kunduz, reported no casualties. In the month of November, Afghanistan experienced significant natural disasters, particularly due to heavy rainfall and subsequent flash floods. On November 23, heavy rainfall led to flash floods that severely impacted several districts in Kunduz, Baghlan, and Balkh provinces, resulting in the deaths of two children aged 10 months and one year. In terms of damages to infrastructure, approximately 460 houses, including mosques and madrasas, were destroyed. Approximately 30 drinking water wells were destroyed, increasing the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"Humanitarian partners and local authorities are conducting search and rescue efforts, and assessments are ongoing.

The situation, which is still unfolding, has caused internal displacement and homelessness. Indeed, over 100 severely injured people have been recorded as a result of fallen walls and trees. On 8 July, the Head of State summoned an emergency meeting while the windstorm was still ongoing, requesting for support from all well-wishers for the affected communities. As the storm continues, ten deaths have been confirmed as a result of collapsed buildings. According to the Meteorological Department, on 7 July, the windspeed was at 85 km per hour and was the first of its kind to be recorded in the last five years. The unfolding disaster has already caused considerable damage on the lives and livelihoods of the people. Many affected people have “no place to live and nothing to eat” said the Executive Director of National Disaster Management Agency (NMDA) at a press briefing at their head office in Kanifing on 8 July 2021 at 3:00pm, attended by the Gambia Red Cross Society (GRCS) Secretary General and essential staff. The GRCS, the NDMA and other partners immediately launched a joint rapid assessment which is still ongoing. Preliminary information as of 12 July 2021 from an assessment indicates that more than 16,849 people (approximately 1,057 households) are affected, including more than 1,531 internally displaced persons (IDPs), among whom many are currently being sheltered by relatives and host families. Preliminary information reports the destruction of several houses, schools and health centres and community seed storage facilities in some of the affected villages. However, in the process of developing the Emergency Plan of Action many more reports are indicating a sharp increase in the number of affected people and households throughout the country. The GRCS has consequently deployed rapid assessment teams to the affected areas/regions. The National Society (NS) is conducting initial distribution of household items to the most vulnerable and dignity packs alongside the assessment exercise. The Gambia has a sub-tropical climate with sunshine throughout the year with average temperatures between 29°C and 34°C. The rainy season runs from June to September and sometimes beyond. The country has experienced over the past few years extensive downpours causing severe destruction as a result of poor draining systems, afforestation, felling of trees for new settlements (new estate developers) etc., causing floods, destruction and untold suffering. The rainy/farming season has just begun with forecasts indicating intermitted heavy rainfall accompanied by severe windstorms. These imminent precipitations may further complicate the situation and severe consequences on the rural population in particular are expected. Twelve people have so far died and more than 109,000 people were affected by the windstorm and flash flood which hit Gambia on 7 July. More losses to food stocks have been recorded, with farmers experiencing erratic rainfalls, requiring increased preparedness by the government and partners related to food security.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"The National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is providing 1,071 households in North Bank and West Coast Regions with US$144 cash transfer, for three months.

Initial assessments indicate that the major drivers of the current increased malaria transmission include low use of preventive measures (coverage of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets stands at less than 50% after the last universal distribution campaigns in 2017); low population immunity in the wake of increased mobility, especially for the people living in the mountains where malaria transmission is usually very low; climatic changes and vector ecological and behavioural changes (increased vector density and feeding habits – biting both indoors and outdoors as well as higher vector aggressiveness). The national malaria outbreak response plan, which is currently being validated, has highlighted a lack of human, logistical and financial resources for effective response. All stakeholders, including the national authorities and partners are called upon to provide the requisite resources to mount a robust response to this event before it escalates. The number of health districts that have passed the epidemic threshold has continued to increase in May. Nine health districts are above the alert threshold and thirty-three are above the epidemic threshold. The number of cases recorded since the start of the year now exceeds three million, a fifty per cent increase compared to the same period in 2018. In week 29 (week ending 21 July 2019), 152,243 cases including 65 deaths have been reported from 39/46 districts. There is a 164% increase in the number of cases reported in week 29 of 2019 compared to week 29 of 2018 and a 13.5% decrease in the number of cases reported in week 29 compared to week 28 of 2019. Eight more cases have been reported in week 29 compared to week 28 of 2019. From week 1 (week ending 5 January 2019) to week 29 of 2019, a cumulative total of 5,738,661 cases and 1,801 deaths (CFR 0.03%) have been reported. Since week 48 of 2018 (week ending 2 December 2018), there has been a progressive increase in the number of malaria cases reported across the 46 districts of Burundi, with the epidemic threshold surpassed in week 18 (week ending 5 May 2019). In week 34 (week ending 25 August 2019), 109,386 cases including 66 deaths have been reported. There is a 125% increase in the number of cases reported in week 34 of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The outbreak of malaria in Burundi is ongoing, with a persistent high incidence of cases across the country. From 1 January to 20 October 2019, a cumulative total of 7,233,138 malaria cases with 2,691 deaths (case fatality ratio 0.03%) have been reported across the country. A total of 23 (49%) out of the 47 health districts of Burundi have surpassed the epidemic threshold, while ten (21.4%) have reached the alert threshold. In week 51 (week ending 22 December 2019), 152,960 cases including 63 deaths have been reported. There is a 90% increase in the number of cases reported in week 51 of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. After the increase in the number of malaria episodes in 2019, a progressive reduction of cases has been observed since the beginning of the year.

The deep depression was moved along the coast of the eastern and northeastern parts of the country, and it was located approximately 100 km northeast of Trincomalee district on 27 November 2024. On 29 November 2024, the Department of Meteorology issued a ‘Red’ alert warning for Cyclone “Fengal” over the Southwest Bay of Bengal for the land and the deep and shallow sea areas around the island. As per the warning, the deep Depression over Southwest Bay of Bengal moved north-northwestwards and intensified into a cyclonic storm “Fengal” and was located about 280 km northeast of Kankasanthurai and 310 km north-northeast of Trincomalee. Due to the extreme weather conditions caused by Storm Fengal, rainfall exceeding 200 mm has been recorded in the Eastern, Northeastern, North Central, and Northern Provinces. Very strong winds, reaching speeds of up to 60 km/h, have caused damage to infrastructure, homes, and agricultural lands in these areas. Furthermore, the intensity of flooding has increased due to the release of water from medium-sized reservoirs, leading to a significant influx of flash floods. 46 minor to medium reservoirs in the Eastern and Northern provinces reported damage. Additionally, the level 2 spill gates of major reservoirs in the Ampara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Mullaitivu, and Anuradhapura districts were opened to release excess water, which resulted in further damage to small bridges and canals in many areas.

Medecins Sans Frontières is conducting a Measles outbreak investigation field mission in the affected area. Based on the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, only one in four children aged 12-23 months (25%) is fully immunised. A stock of 60 000 vaccination doses funded by DG ECHO is available in-country for the local response. Health authorities on 8 June declared a measles epidemic after 540 cases and 23 deaths were recorded. The disease has erupted in 89 districts, 10 of which have reached the epidemic level. A US$589,000-response plan by the Government, NGO and UN partners is underway to vaccinate around 572,000 children. Measles is one of the leading causes of death among young children. Between week 1 and week 26 (ending 1 July 2018) of 2018, a total of 1284 suspected cases with 49 deaths (CFR 3.8%) have been reported.

Between week 1 and week 36 (week ending 9 September 2018), a total of 2 734 suspected cases of measles were reported including 78 deaths (case fatality ratio 2.9%). The average age is 9.9 years and the median age was 6 years. About 39% of the affected people are four years of age and below, 23% are between five and nine years and 37% are 10 years and above. Only 15% (150) of the investigated cases had previously been vaccinated against measles. In the reporting week, two new district reported a confirmed case, Mao and Karal. As of reporting date, a total of 27 districts have had a confirmed measles outbreak. In week 36, 155 suspected cases with no deaths were reported.

A measles epidemic since May 2018 has been declining in the past two weeks according to health authorities. In the week ending on 12 May, 846 cases were recorded, compared with 921 the week before and 1,296 in late April. The drop is attributed to the start of the rainy season in some provinces. Measles outbreak usually occurs during the dry seasons between September and May. In week 37 (week ending 15 September 2019), 265 suspected cases and 2 associated deaths were reported. 15 districts were in the epidemic phase in week 37. Since the beginning of the year, a total of 24 330 suspected cases and 241 deaths (CFR 1.0%) have been reported with Am Timan, N’Djamena East, N’Djamena South, Bongor, Moundou, Bousso and N’Djamena Centre districts all exceeding 1 000 suspected cases.

In week 1 of 2020 (week ending 5 January 2020), 123 suspected measles cases were reported from 22 of the 126 districts in Chad. The measles outbreak in Chad continues to evolve, with the number of new cases rapidly increasing in the last weeks, as is the growing number of affected districts. The number of new cases has been gradually increasing since week 1 of 2020, when 127 suspected cases were reported. From weeks 1-6, 2020, a cumulative total of 1 276 suspected measles cases, including 14 deaths (case fatality ratio 1.1%), have been reported from 52 (41%) out of 126 districts of the country. The measles outbreak in Chad has been ongoing since 2018. In 2019, a total of 26 623 suspected measles cases, including 259 deaths (case fatality ratio 1.0%) were reported from 36 districts. In week 8 (week ending 23 February 2020), 621 suspected cases were reported. 29 districts were in the epidemic phase in week 8. Since the beginning of the year, a total of 2 410 suspected cases and 23 deaths (CFR 1.0%) have been reported from Beboto, Kyabe, Goundi, Korbol, Kelo and Guelao. As attention and resources are shifting more and more towards COVID-19 prevention and response activities in Chad, the country is still grappling with a persistent measles epidemic that shows no signs of slowing down. 118 out of 126 health districts in Chad have been affected since the epidemic outbreak in May 2018, with southern provinces facing a rapid increase in cases. As of 30 April 2020, 28 health districts were in a declared measles epidemic. The Ministry of Public Health reported 7,635 suspected cases, with the highest number of registered cases in Beboto, Kyabe and Goundi health districts. In February, and before the first COVID-19 case in Chad was confirmed on 19 March, a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) emergency response team travelled to measles-affected regions, including Bebote, which is the most heavily impacted. As a result, 25,177 children aged between six months and nine years were vaccinated against measles. As of 25 October, 8,601 suspected cases of measles and 39 deaths have been notified in 100 out of 126 districts (during the same period in 2019, the tally was 25,283 suspected cases and 242 deaths). However, a period of higher transmission of the disease is expected. This is prompting the planning of a vaccination campaign in epidemic-prone health districts.

About 12,000 people in West New Britain and 4,000 people in East New Britain have been affected by the eruption. About 6,800 people have evacuated and are in two care centres in West New Britain. The volcanic activity is subsiding, and the alert level is expected to be lowered from level 2 to 1. Between 3,000 and 5,000 people voluntarily evacuated the immediate vicinity of Ulawun. The ash plume is moving generally south but has slowed in recent hours. Air Niugini has cancelled flights to Hoskins Airport until further assessments are made. The cluster system is to be activated in response to food, water, shelter and non-food item needs among the evacuees. As the area has been cut off from the highway, relief items will be transported by road from Kimbe to Bialla, and then via helicopter to those affected. Approximately 10,620 people have congregated in at least ten care centre sites, according to local-level government authorities in Bialla, West New Britain. Another 427 people are in a single care centre in East New Britain. No casualties have been reported. Ashfall has been observed across Talesea District, and down to Kimbe. The authorities in West New Britain have declared a provincial state of emergency and have activated their emergency response plan for Mt. Ulawun, including the establishment of a forward base in Bialla. All communities within a 20-kilometre radius of the volcano were instructed to relocate to designated safe zones. Hoskins airport was opened at 17:00 today by the airport authority, National Airports Corporation. It is expected that Air Niugini flights will resume over the weekend pending an air quality assessment. As of 2 July, approximately 13,250 people have congregated in at least 9 care centre sites in West New Britain. Two people have been reportedly sustained light injuries during the relocation. Overcrowding has been observed in the care centre sites. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a large number of people are staying in open areas without shelter, minimal food supplies, with limited access to clean drinking water, latrines, and sanitation. There are public health risks of vector-borne diseases, measles, and other vaccine-preventable and diarrhoeal diseases. Due to heavy ashfall remaining on the runway, Air Niugini flights into Hoskins Airport were cancelled again as of 1 July until a further review is undertaken by the airline. As of 5 July, there is an estimated 7,318 people staying in seven evacuation sites in West New Britain Province, and 2,538 people are staying in one evacuation site in East New Britain Province, according to IOM displacement profiles. In West New Britain, 86 per cent of those displaced are staying in the government-run care centres, with around 16 per cent staying in open spaces or with no shelter. Five of the six sites reported health-related concerns, including malaria and coughs and only one site was reported to have health services. In East New Britain, around 85 per cent of people displaced are living in makeshift shelters. The site was reported to lack functioning toilets or separate bathing facilities and the primary source of drinking water are nearby streams. Reported health problems include malaria and diarrhoea; there are no health services available near the site. As of 12 Jul, the Rabaul Volcanological Observatory’s (RVO) preliminary assessment indicates that people evacuated in East New Britain Province may return home immediately, while those evacuated in West New Britain Province may be able to return home in a week’s time. The alert level remains at 1, indicating a low threat to life. West New Britain provincial authorities have downgraded the State of Emergency on 12 July, noting that it would be scaling down operations and officers would be returning to their normal duties. Gaps remain in addressing evacuees’ needs at care centres, apart from food. A major concern remains the risk of disease outbreaks due to a lack of access to water, poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, and general living conditions at the care centres and other evacuation sites. A government assessment of communities home to approximately 7,500 people, showed nearly all household food gardens were covered in ash and likely lost. Schools, due to resume on 8 July, remained suspended. Evacuees are still located in informal sites along the Pandi River. Access to clean water and sanitation and hygiene continue to be priorities, as well as a growing need to address psychosocial issues and establish safe recreational zones for children and support programs for women. The Government has distributed US$66,700 worth of food relief to evacuation sites, and public health authorities have provided medical assistance. In-country support from humanitarian partners has included provision of food, emergency shelter items and non-food items, essential medicines and supplies, and nutritional supplements. Ulawun volcano, on the island of New Britain, erupted on 3 August, producing a short but strong eruption with a 100 metre fire fountain and an 19,000 metre ash plume. Further imminent eruptions are unlikely and as of 5 August, the risk level, which was at ‘Stage 3’, has been downgraded to ‘Stage 1.’ Communities to the west and southwest of the volcano, such as Navo, Kabaya and Kimbe, have been most severely affected. A response team from the West New Britain Provincial Disaster Centre is supporting ongoing relief operations and conducting an assessment on the impact of the ashfall. Approximately 8,000 people remain displaced following earlier eruptions of Ulawan in June, with many of the displaced people still living in care centres. Ulawun erupted at about 5:00 a.m. local time (UTC+10) on 1 October, following a swarm of seismic activity that began around 11:30 a.m. local time on 30 September. The eruption was visible from red incandescent glow shooting up less than 100m from the base and an ash plume rising less than 1,000 metres. Preliminary observations suggest areas in the westerly direction may be affected by ashfall, but the current level of exposure to ashfall remains low. The West New Britain Provincial Disaster Centre reported that 6 care centres are open for evacuating residents. As of two weeks ago, approximately 6,200 people were staying in the care centres, which had remained open since the previous eruptions. Following the Mount Ulawun eruption on 1 October, the volcanic explosion activity continues, the ash plume rose 6,100 m altitude and is moving in south-west direction at 37 km/h. The eruption has forced the evacuation of several people who recently returned to their homes, following a previous eruption and evacuation. As of 10.00 a.m. local time on 2 October, the eruption of Ulawun continues via a new vent, low on its south-west flank. The alert level remains at stage 3, indicating a high threat to life. Seismicity remains high with tremors of similar intensity or slightly above. If the eruption continues, or the lava effusion rate increases, areas to the north-west of the current vent may be affected. Ash can be expected in down-wind areas. The activity of Mount Ulawun (West New Britain Province, New Britain island) is slightly decreasing since the ash plume rose approximately 3,000 m. According to media, people living close to the volcano have been preventively evacuated. The Manam volcano (Manam island) located 700 km west of Mount Ulawun began to erupt on 28 September and, as of 2 October, the ash column has risen to 3,000 m. There are no reports of any casualties or damage. According to the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, as of 2 October, a red aviation color code has been issued both for Ulawun and Manam. Mount Ulawun in West New Britain erupted on 1 October. Eruptions continued for several days, sending ash several kilometres in the air. Lava flowed up to 3km from the north-west side of the vent, but the lava flow did not cause any damage to life or property. On 7 October, the Rabaul Volcanological Observatory (RVO) lowered the alert level to Stage 2. Seven care centres, hosting around 6,200 people from previous eruptions, remain open in the area, providing food assistance to those displaced.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"The West New Britain provincial authorities are assessing the affected area.

The floods displaced approximately 1,800 households in Bor South and submerged crops in Duk. The NOAA/NCEP Global Ensemble Forecast System shows a sustained likelihood of heavy rainfall through August 10, 2020, in eastern South Sudan. Although the scale of flooding is lower in 2020 compared to 2019 so far, a consecutive year of flood-induced crop and livestock losses in low-lying areas along the Nile River and Pibor-Akobo-Sobat basin would exacerbate existing food insecurity into the post-harvest period. Engineering troops serving with the UN Mission in South Sudan are engaged in an ongoing battle against flooding caused by broken dykes in Bor, in Jonglei, aggravated by heavy downpours. Across the state, primarily in Bor South and Twic East, some 135,000 people are believed to be displaced. The situation is worsened by the onset of the rainy season, which has led to the displacement of over 5,000 people due to floods in Bor South and Twic East counties in Jonglei. According to local authorities, the number goes up to 150,000 for eastern Jonglei. Heavy rainfall has been affecting central and eastern States of the country (in particular Jonglei, Eastern Nile, and Pibor States) since late July, causing the White Nile River, and the Akobo River to overflow, triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. In Jonglei State, media report as of 14 August, around 200,000 displaced people, and thousands of destroyed houses across Bor South, Twic East, Duk, and Ayod Counties. In the eastern part of Upper Nile State, approximately 30,000 people were reported affected across the Renk County. In Pibor state, a number of families were reported displaced throughout Pochalla County. More than 600,000 people have been affected by flooding in areas along the White Nile since July, with Jonglei and Lakes the worst affected states. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the centre of the country. The majority of people displaced moved to higher ground near their homes and plan to return once the flood waters recede. In Bor South, over 33,000 people earlier displaced by conflict and flooding in Twic East and Duk counties to the north have moved west into Awerial county, and are now sheltering in Mingkaman town IDP settlement. Widespread flooding continued in October, affecting over half of the country and disrupting the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people. An estimated 856,000 people were affected by flooding since July with some 400,000 people displaced. An estimated 1,042,000 people have been affected by floods in South Sudan. Jonglei State and the Greater Pibor Administrative Area are the worst affected (a total of 495,000 people affected). Flood-affected people’s urgent needs include food and livelihood support, emergency shelter and non-food items (ES/NFI), and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health and protection services.

Since 9 September, heavy rains caused by the monsoon season and remnants of Typhoon Yagi have led to severe flooding across Myanmar. Central Myanmar is currently the hardest hit. The flood impacted 59 townships in nine regions and states, including the state’s capital, Nay Pyi Taw, Bago, Kayah, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, and eastern and southern Shan. There has been significant damage to road networks, transportation, telecommunications, and electricity in affected areas. Most areas remain flooded, although some townships have started to see receding water levels. While data verification is challenging, an estimated 631,000 people might have been affected by flooding across the country. Myanmar: As of 17 September, there has been 113 reported deaths. In Mandalay, more than 53,000 people were affected in Yamethin. The Sa Mone Dam breach flooded 12 villages, submerged 40,000 acres of farmland, and left 10,000 people in urgent need of aid. Flooding in Bago worsened in Taungoo Township, surpassing August flood levels and affecting 1,200 households. In total more than 87,000 people affected in six townships in Bago Region. In Eastern Shan, flash floods destroyed a key bridge, disrupting transportation and communication. Southern Shan faced widespread flooding, affecting 13 townships, with more than half the area inundated, including tourism infrastructure. In the Southeast, Mon, Kayin, and Kayah states experienced severe flooding, displacing people and damaging infrastructure, particularly in IDP camps and low-lying areas. In Nay Pyi Taw, four townships were heavily flooded, affecting around 60,000 people. As of 27 September, the severe floods caused more than 360 fatalities, with more than 100 people missing and 320,000 people displaced, forcing them into temporary camps/evacuation centres that were often overcrowded and lacked sufficient access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities. Likewise, the floods and landslides caused the destruction of more than 141,000 buildings, including homes, schools, offices, and critical infrastructure, such as 533 roads and bridges. Furthermore, several concurrent low-pressure systems around Bay of Bengal resulted in persistent rains, leading to additional flooding. In the beginning of October, recurrent flooding impacted Mandalay region, Eastern and Southern Shan states, disrupting needs analysis, relief deliveries, and humanitarian assistance efforts, while compounding the needs of the vulnerable population affected by multiple hazards. Local markets, health facilities, and homes were devastated, significantly reducing access to food, water, and medical supplies. In Lao PDR, Tropical Cyclone Yagi and the Southwest Monsoon have affected 1,208 villages across 106 districts in 15 provinces, including Vientiane Capital and Borikhamxay. According to the NDMO Lao PDR, the cyclone and monsoon have resulted in seven fatalities and impacted approximately 185,800 people (76,100 families). The estimated cost of damages stands at around 7.9 million USD, with significant destruction including 252 road sections, 77 schools, 11 health facilities, 298 houses, and 24,600 hectares of agricultural land. An estimated 48,500 children have been impacted, with at least 24,000 children in need of critical support. Approximately 92,000 people are in need of water, sanitation, and health services; 10,000 children and adolescents affected by the floods are in need of community-based mental health and psychosocial support activities. Some 3.6 million people in nearly half (26) of Viet Nam’s 63 provinces and cities were affected by the typhoon and subsequent floods and landslides. Across the country, more than 240,599 homes, 1,530 schools, and 570 health facilities were damaged, with another 73,248 homes submerged in floodwaters. More than 72,500 people are estimated to be in need of safe shelter as a result of destroyed or severely damaged homes. About 570,000 people, including approx.163,020 children, are in need of assistance. The hardest-hit areas include rural, ethnic minorities and low-income communities where children were already facing multiple challenges. Typhoon Yagi was recorded as the strongest typhoon Viet Nam has experienced in the past 30 years. It affected the entire northern region, home to a population of 19 million. Among the 12 most damaged provinces, Lao Cai, Tuyen Quang, and Yen Bai have declared a state of emergency. As of 27 September 2024, the typhoon resulted in 318 deaths, 26 missing persons, 1,976 injuries, the evacuation of over 130,000 people, and initial damages amounting to more than VND 81,000 billion (approximately CHF 2,43 billion), as reported in the conference on “Preliminary, evaluating, learning experiences on the prevention and overcoming of the consequences of typhoon No. 3” chaired by the Prime Minister of Viet Nam and attended by the leaders of ministries, branches, 26 provinces and cities. The typhoon left a trail of devastation, affecting public and private properties, including offices, schools, and buildings, many of which suffered roof damage, while large areas experienced disruptions to telecommunications and power. As of 23 October, the Viet Nam Disaster and Dyke Management Authority (VDDMA) reported 321 deaths, 24 people missing, and 1,978 people injured. Many homes, healthcare facilities, schools were also damaged because of Typhoon Yagi and subsequent rains and landslides. The Typhoon affected 3,6 million people across 26 provinces, with the response prioritizing 1,6 million people in 11 provinces. Efforts are focused on reaching 570,000 individuals in need, targeting 300,000 in the three hardest-hit provinces: Yen Bai, Lao Cai, and Cao Bang. Following the devastation caused by Typhoon Yagi—one of the most powerful storms to hit Southeast Asia in decades – heavy rains have continued to batter many of the hardest-hit areas. Needs assessments reveal that over 5.6 million people, including at least 1.6 million children, were directly affected by the resulting floods and landslides across Viet Nam, Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Thailand. The disaster has severely disrupted access to clean water, essential social services, education, healthcare, food, and shelter, leaving millions in urgent need of assistance. [In Vietnam], three months after the typhoon children and families in affected areas still face acute deprivations and risks. Health and water systems remain damaged, denying 570,000 people access to safe drinking water and clean sanitation, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks and interruptions to routine immunization. About 220,000 children under five and 70,000 pregnant and lactating women remain at risk of malnutrition due to disrupted health and other services, food shortages and lack of clean water. Over 830,000 children in the worst-affected areas experienced a loss of 60-120 hours of learning and are being impacted by the damage to school infrastructure and learning materials. Disruptions of education in typhoon-affected regions, which already have lower learning outcomes, are increasing existing disparities, especially among ethnic minority children.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"The Government of Viet Nam, with support of local authorities, mobilized a large-scale response, deploying over 438,000 officers, soldiers, communal disaster response teams, and mass organization members, assisting in evacuations, and coordinating with national and international partners for immediate relief efforts.

About 1.1 million people are still without access to safe water. The UN is also helping the Ministry of Health with the procurement of 50,000 cholera vaccine doses after authorities detected 16 cases, 12 among Haitian migrants. There are concerns that damages to water management systems may aggravate an ongoing dengue outbreak that has led to 12,000 cases so far in 2023. According to information from 22 November, 7,412 homes were affected, 14 partially affected and 22 were destroyed. At least 37,060 people were displaced to safe areas and 55 communities are isolated. A total of 4 shelters were opened, housing 158 people, and 59 water services were affected, of which 55 are inoperable. Almost three weeks after intense rainfall and flooding hit the Dominican Republic on 17 and 18 November, a Damage and Needs Assessment conducted in North Santo Domingo and the province of Duarte indicates that populations in the most affected communities require food, clean water, hygiene and sanitation supplies, medicines, and the repair or reconstruction of homes. According to estimations from the government’s social protection system (SIUBEN), the flooding affected at least 340,000 people in the provinces of Duarte, Santo Domingo, San José de Ocoa, Barahona, Bahoruco, San Juan de la Maguana, Sánchez Ramírez, Peravia, Azua, Distrito Nacional and San Cristóbal. Some 34 people died, 37,000 were displaced and approximately 7,412 homes were severely damaged.

The widespread impact of the event highlights the vulnerabilities of the country and the need to strengthen capacities to prevent, prepare and respond effectively. On 21 December 2023, the Emergency Operation Center of Dominican Republic (COE per its acronym in Spanish) published information about the heavy rains in the country.

Assessments are still ongoing in affected areas that are difficult to access due to insecurity. Humanitarian partners have so far provided 673 flood-affected households with tents, NFIs including winter clothes, food assistance and hygiene kits. The Government has reportedly allocated 126 million Afghanis (US$1.7m) for assistance including shelter repairs, agricultural assistance and food. Since 2 March, there has also been extensive flooding in Hilmand, Herat and Farah provinces, and humanitarian partners are continuing to conduct assessments and provide assistance in these areas. Heavy rainfall has being affecting central, southern and western Afghanistan over the past two weeks, triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The most affected provinces are Kandahar, Helmand, Farah, Herat and Badghis. According to ACAPS (Assessment Capacities Project), as of 13 March, the death toll stands at 70, more than 8,670 houses have been damaged and approximately 250,000 people have been affected. Infrastructure damage, rugged terrain and the ongoing rainfall are hindering the response. Insecurity throughout the country remains high and may restrict operations. Nevertheless, the humanitarian response is being put in place to assist those affected with emergency shelter, food, non-food items, winter clothes and emergency latrines. Over the next 72 hours, locally heavy rain and snowfall are forecast over Kabul area and north-eastern areas of the country.

The highest number of affected people are in Farah, where almost 52,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance. A further 32,750 people in Kandahar and 18,340 people in Hilmand also require assistance. Heavy rains caused flash flooding on 27, 28 and 29 March in six provinces - Faryab, Balkh, Jawzjan, and Sar-e-Pul province in the Northern Region, and Hirat and Badghis in the Western Region. An estimated 17,000 people have been affected with Balkh and Hirat suffering the worst impacts. In Balkh, unconfirmed reports suggest several fatalities in Chemtal district, with up to 645 families (4,515 people) affected throughout the Province. In Hirat, Ministry of Health has reported that eight people died and nine were injured in six districts following flash flooding, while more than 1,000 families may have been affected.

Since the beginning of 2019, more than 163,000 people have now been affected by floods, including those in the past week. A total of more than 42,000 people have been displaced. After heavy rainfall that affected 22 out of the 34 Provinces of Afghanistan over the past few days, the death toll has risen to at least 16. According to media, as of 18 April at 8.00 UTC, in eastern Nangarhar Province, 11 people have died, six are injured and 266 houses were washed away, while in the western Province of Herat the death toll stands at five. Unseasonal heavy rains and floods affected a number of regions of Afghanistan as well as Kabul, between 13 and 19 April. As of 22 April, 1,700 people have been affected with 16 people killed, 112 injured, and 250 houses damaged or destroyed due to flash floods. The floods have also damaged crops and infrastructure, including roads.

It is anticipated that more rains shall fall in the coming months with little resources on the ground to respond to the needs of people in different provinces. The resilience of people in most of the provinces is already weak because of earlier protracted drought. There is a huge need in emergency shelter on the ground. Besides, there is continuous population movement from the rural villages to safer places with available humanitarian assistance and better basic services. Heavy rainfall in recent days has triggered flash floods in a number of areas with Kabul, Parwan, Ghour, Herat, Bamyan and Ghazni most affected. According to media reports, as of 27 May at 8.00 UTC, 24 people have died, 11 are injured and 550 affected. 220 houses have been destroyed and 116 partially damaged.

Typhoon Sarika made landfall in the Philippines in Aurora province, eastern Luzon on 15 October, as a strong Typhoon. It crossed Luzon swiftly, passing through the provinces of Aurora, Nueva Vizcava, Nueva Ecija and Pangasinan, losing strength but remaining a typhoon. The National Disaster Management Agency in the morning of 17 October (UTC) reported no casualties, about 200 houses damaged, minor landslides and power cuts. Around 40,000 people were preemptively evacuated and about 25,000 of them were still in shelters as of same date. Typhoon Sarika emerged over the South China Sea a few hours after landfall in the Philippines and moved W-NW in the general direction of Hainan province of China. As of 03 November, the official partial estimates of damage caused by both typhoons Sarika and Haima, which hit northern Luzon on 19 October, included 248,872 tonnes of lost crops. Large numbers of people are still living in temporary shelters and relying on humanitarian support. Most of the population affected by the typhoons are critically dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods and many are vulnerable to food insecurity. As of 04 November, preliminary official estimates indicated that about 400,000 hectares of paddy, maize and high value crops (such as mango, banana, papaya, cassava and vegetables) were adversely affected by both typhoons Haima and Sarika. The overall damage to the agriculture sector was estimated to be close to USD 234 million. However, the overall impact on 2016 cereal crops is expected to be limited. On 18 October, Typhoon Sarika made landfall on China\\'s southern island of Hainan as a Category 2 typhoon with torrential rain and winds of up to 162 km/h. Nearly 500,000 people were evacuated from coastal and low-lying areas.

In December 2014, delayed rains had negative impacts on crop production. The delay prolonged the lean period for households and reduced agriculture labor opportunities, adversely impacting incomes among households that were dependent on markets for food purchases. Approximately 640,000 people were identified as food insecure countrywide. An estimated 640,009 persons were assessed to be food insecure in 19 districts by the 2014 Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC), a sharp decrease compared with the 1.46 million people estimated in the previous year.

The departments where incidents have been recorded for the rainy season are Guatemala with 18 incidents; Quiché with 17 incidents; as well as 10 incidents in San Marcos, 10 in Huehuetenango and another 10 in the department of Jutiapa. The incidents which have occurred were floods, landslides and landslides. The rainy season will not end until November, and so far 144,415 people have been affected. There have been 1,470 evacuees, 938 victims, 667 people have been sheltered, and 16 people have reportedly died in the current rainy season 2017. Between 2-3 September, floods were reported in the departments of Alta Verapaz, Petén and Suchitepéquez, with 2,466 people affected and damage in 438 homes, according to damage assessments and needs analysis carried out by institutions of the National Coordinating System for Disaster Reduction. According to the Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology National Institute (INSIVUMEH), heavy rainfall on 18 September of 2017, caused floodings throughout Guatemala, particularly in the north-western region of the country. Floods were registered in the municipalities of San Felipe, Santa Cruz Muluá, San Martín Zapotitlán, Mazatenango’s urban centre, Colotenango’s urban centre, Calle de la Cruz, Callejón 10, Campo Borrayo, and the cantons of Icán, La otra banda and Tulula, among other areas. When the Guatemalan Red Cross Damage Analysis and Needs Assessment (DANA) teams were deployed to the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez, the departmental delegate from CONRED reported that the flooding affected 629 people, forced 164 people to evacuate from their homes and 97 people to seek shelter in collective centres, damaged 68 roads and impacted 1 bridge in the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez. In the departments of Suchitepéquez and Retalhuleu, floods have damaged homes, crops and household goods. Around 2,016 families are affected according to local authorities. The flood-stricken families preferred to find their own shelter since the collective centres assigned by local authorities do not have electricity, running water, toilets, showers or kitchens, and are far away from people’s homes; the loss of bedding, clothing, blankets and the necessary tools for their livelihoods, among other items has also prompted affected people to seek their own shelter to safeguard the few belongings they still have left. Local authorities have declared an orange level for the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez to be able to provide emergency assistance to the affected areas, and on September 27 2017, CONRED declared Red Alert in Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez, to provide assistance to the local emergencies. Continuous rains have fallen in the department of Alta Verapaz for the entire month of October 2017, affecting 62 rural and urban communities in 8 municipalities due to increased water levels and the overflow of the Cahabón, Chixoy, Icbolay and Polochic Rivers. The heavy rains that continue to pound the area are compounded by the presence of an easterly wave, the arrival of Tropical Storm Selma, increased humidity saturation levels and swollen rivers that threaten to impact further already flooded areas. As of 31 October 2017, 13 collective centres have been opened to house more than 999 people, whose homes were directly affected. Alta Verapaz is one of the largest maize producers in Guatemala, accounting for 10 per cent of the total production in the country; however, crops are being lost to the flooding, which puts small and medium-sized farmers’ food security at risk for the next few months, according to information provided by the Guatemalan Red Cross (GRC) branch in Cobán. Per official reports, 450 hectares owned by 1,097 families have been affected in the municipality of Chisec, Raxruhá and Panzós.

In addition, the mudslides rush down to the roads and Duhok city suffers severe floods. This is caused by the receiving of 80 mm rainwater on Thursday in many districts across the KRI, and more rains are forecasted in the country. Current torrential rains and flooding also caused damage to pavements and road infrastructure. According to the authorities, 16 villages are affected by the floods and have been cut off from the main city due to the blockage of roads.

The provinces of Diyala, Wassit and Maysan, due to their proximity to neighbouring Iran, also witnessed flooding in the past.

According to the latest report of UN OCHA, almost 623,000 people have been affected across 16 of the 23 Provinces, including the Capital N’Djamena with 44,839 affected people. The worst-hit Provinces are Tandjilé (southern Chad) with 166,258 affected people, followed by Logone (147,129 people), Mandoul (82,608), and Sila (77,357). In the capital, N’Djamena, a quarter of the city is flooded, and the humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly as over 50,000 people were displaced in the span of just days. This figure may double in the next week, as waters of the Logone and Chari rivers from the south continue to flood the capital on their way to Lake Chad. Since September 8, heavy rains battered the south of the country, causing the Chari and Logone rivers (which meet in the capital city of N\\'Djamena) to overflow their banks and forcing 181,720 people (28,907 households) to flee their homes and take refuge in public spaces. The flooding is a result of heavy rainfall across the country, overflowing of rivers and/or the breaching of dikes. As of January 20, 2023, the most affected provinces are Lac with 250,091 victims, Mayo Kebbi Est with 228,708 victims, Mayo Kebi Ouest (50,022 victims), Logone Occidental (147,129 victims), Logone Oriental (10,052 victims), Tandjilé (138,831 victims), Mandoul (82,608 victims), Salamat (19,080 victims), Sila (92,600 victims), Guéra (65,047 victims), and Batha (26,466 victims). More than 1.4 million people were affected by floods in Chad in 2022 and many of them remain displaced in several camps in N\\'Djamena and Lac provinces. As of 29 of March 2023, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated that around 300,000 people were still in dire needs of assistance in several sites in N\\'Djamena and Bol. The Chadian government plans to close the sites in April before the start of the rainy season.

In Hadramaut, houses, road bridges, water networks, and crops were destroyed and livestock drowned in Al Sawm, Hajr, Mayfa and Brom districts. Sites for internally displaced people (IDPs) were worst affected where rains destroyed shelters and property and led to stagnant water. Initial findings suggest that at least 4,625 families have been affected in 60 IDP sites. An estimated 21,240 families (148,680 people) have been affected by flooding in 13 governorates since mid-April. Conditions are hardest for thousands of families already displaced who have lost shelter, food rations and household supplies. In Marib Governorate, torrential rains affected 6,286 families including 7 fatalities while 250 people were injured. The rains also caused houses to collapse, and damaged infrastructure making some roads impassable in Raymah Governorate and Marib City and surrounding areas. In Sana’a and northern governorates, at least 9,146 families were affected, with Sana’a City and most parts of Sana’a governorate particularly badly hit by flooding. Over 5,130 families have been affected in Hajjah Governorate alone, and partners have reported severe damage to shelters at sites for internally displaced persons (IDPs) as a result urgent needs for WASH interventions and food assistance are required. An estimated 4,764 households have been affected in IDP sites in southern governorates, including 1,812 families in Aden, 1,037 in Abyan, 917 in Taizz and 770 in Lahj governorates.

At sites, for internally displaced people (IDPs) across southern governorates, initial assessments indicated that at least 5,537 displaced families were affected by the rains in 69 locations. In Mualla District in Aden, 100 families from the local community have been displaced by the floods besides flooding to two schools. Heavy rain has been affecting several Governorates of the country (in particular Hadhramaut, Shabwa and Al Mahrah) since the last few days, causing widespread floods and resulting in casualties and damage. According to media reports, 16 people died in eastern Hadhramaut and central Shabwa. Around 130 people have been displaced, 25 houses flooded and hundreds of livestock have been killed by flood events in Hadhramaut.

It made landfall over Hainan about 30km east of Yaxian that evening. Brian passed just south of the city after midnight and soon entered open waters again. It then changed its track west-northwestwards and weakened to a severe tropical storm. Brian made landfall over the northern part of Viet Nam about 230km south of Hanoi on the afternoon of 3 October and weakened rapidly to a tropical storm. As it moved further inland, it further weakened to an area of low pressure in Laos. Brian caused severe flooding in Hainan. About 96,000 hectares of paddy rice were inundated. Forty people were killed and 529 were injured. About 15,900 houses collapsed and 169,000 were damaged. Over 25 million lumber trees and rubber trees were blown down. There were about 1,300 reports of damage of dams and hydro-electric stations and 63 damage reports of bridges. Other damage included 134 boats, 700km of power cables and 2,100 km of telephone lines. The total damage was estimated to be about 837 million RMB. Off the coast of Hainan, a Hong Kong fishing vessel sank on the morning of 3 October. The area was searched but none of the seven crew members was found. Typhoon Angela swept across the northern coast of Luzon during the early hours of 6 October. The flooding caused by Typhoon Angela left at least 118 people dead and 27 injured in northern Philippines. About 1,400 houses were destroyed, 3,300 houses were damaged, and 9,000 people were left homeless. The strong winds also toppled electric and telephone posts. Rice fields and tobacco land were inundated. Crops damaged were estimated to be about 1.6 million pesos. Angela entered the South China Sea on 6 October and weakened considerably after interacting with the terrain of northern Luzon. It continued its westward track across the northern part of the South China Sea at about 13 km/h. It weakened to a severe tropical storm on 10 October and made landfall over Viet Nam about 210 km northwest of Danang. Angela soon dissipated over land. Initial assessment of the damage in Viet Nam was as follows: 52 dead, 762 injured and 52 missing. At least 90,000 houses collapsed or were destroyed. Typhoon Dan swept across the central Philippines during the night of 10 October, and passed just south of Manila the following morning. According to press reports, 57 people were injured and 80 killed in the Philippines during the passage of Dan. Strong winds toppled trees and power pylons in Manila where power supply was cut off for more than 24 hours. The losses from damage to crops and property as well as industrial disruption ran to millions of US dollars. Dan passed about 80 km south-southwest of Yaxian, Hainan early on 13 October. In Hainan, the city of Tongshi was severely flooded with water levels rising to 1.5 metres high. In Lingshui and Yaxian Counties, flooding occurred in several villages and caused some houses to collapse, leaving hundreds of people homeless. Two people were killed and 21 were injured. Damage to agriculture, power supply and communication was severe. The casualties due to Brian, Angela and Dan were reported to be 63 killed, 15 missing and 712 injured. About 30 million rubber trees were blown down. The total loss due to the three typhoons was estimated to be over 1,000 million RMB. Dan weakened to a severe tropical storm on 13 October as it moved towards the Viet Nam coast. It made landfall about 300km south of Hanoi that evening. Dan finally dissipated in Laos about 180 km east-northeast of Vientiane early on 14 October. In Viet Nam, 34 people were killed and 466 were injured. Floods caused by heavy rain swept away some 8,000 houses and several hundred boats. About 134,000 hectares of rice ready for harvest were inundated.

This dryness has affected livestock’s access to water and pastureland, which has led to poor livestock body conditions as many are subsisting on burnt cactus leaves in the absence of viable pastureland. This has similarly affected crop development, with many areas experiencing failed or near failed harvests. Only Ambovombe commune received favorably heavy rains in July that allowed some farmers to plant new maize and potato crops. Poor and very poor households in MG23 (the Mahafaly plains) in the southwest of Madagascar are experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity because of poor or failed agricultural production and the resulting early dependence on markets for food. In Androy Semi-Arid Cassava, Maize and Livestock (MG 24), food security is deteriorating following the harvest period as stocks deplete and poor and very poor households are currently in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) with the exception of Ambovombe where the situation is better. Food insecurity is less severe in the Southeast (MG 19) and Rice and lima bean (MG 20) which remain in Stressed (IPC Phase 2). The rest of the country remains in Minimal (IPC Phase 1). According to Crop and Food Security Assessment (CFSAM) of August 2018, rainfall deficits and fall armyworm attacks have had significant impact on food production levels (particularly staple crops such as maize and cassava), compromising access to food for the majority of households. Southern Madagascar is in the grip of a humanitarian catastrophe, with 1.5 million people—half the region’s population—needing immediate emergency food assistance, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) warned today. Three straight years of drought have wiped out harvests and hampered people\\'s access to food and COVID-19 is compounding their suffering. Those experiencing “crisis” or “emergency” hunger conditions—three times the number forecast mid-year—are mostly children and women. Of the ten hardest-hit southern districts, Amboasary is the epicenter; families barely scrape together enough food with raw mangoes and tamarind often their only food source. Mothers can no longer breastfeed and are forced to give their infants water which is in scarce supply. A WFP assessment in Amboasary last month found three out of four children had quit school - mostly to help their parents forage for food.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"In coordination with the Government of Madagascar and in collaboration with the humanitarian community, WFP’s response plan will focus on providing food and nutritional assistance to the populations that are classified in IPC crisis and in emergency phases from September-December 2018. Out of 1.3 million people who are classified in IPC crisis (3) and emergency (4) phases, WFP aims to provide food assistance and nutritional support to 849,000 people using a combination of food and cash-based modalities. It is expected that other actors in the food security sector (government and NGOs) will provide assistance to 35% of the population in IPC 3 and 4 phases. A second response phase to support drought-affected communities through early recovery interventions is planned for the January-March 2019 period. During both response phases, WFP will work closely with FAO and other food security and livelihoods cluster members to ensure that the assistance provided is complementary. Humanitarian actors are currently delivering assistance to approximately 415,463 beneficiaries across the Grand South, with the highest levels of assistance in Ampanihy and Betoiky. 154,078 beneficiaries are receiving 100,000 MGA per month in cash transfers, and 261,385 beneficiaries are receiving 30 kg of rice, 5 kg of legumes, and 3 kg of cooking oil per month.

The cyclone made landfall over the border area between India, West Bengal state and Bangladesh, Khulna division on 26 May around 18.00 UTC. Tidal surges as high as 12 feet, heavy rainfall, and wind speeds of up to 120 km/h have led to inundation of many southwestern coastal areas of Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, over 800,000 people have been evacuated to safer areas in 16 coastal districts ahead of the cyclone in 9,000 shelters. Tens of thousands of volunteers had been mobilized by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) to quicken the evacuation efforts and relief has already been transported to remote areas. 10,599 houses are so far reported fully destroyed, while 18,605 are reported partially destroyed, and 9 people are reported dead. Millions are without power. Over the next 48 hours, very heavy rainfall and strong winds are expected over West Bengal and most of Bangladesh.

More than 37,000 damaged houses were reported across the affected states. In Bangladesh, around 807,000 people have been evacuated in nearly 9,500 shelters and around 70,285 houses have been completely destroyed, 107,176 of which partially damaged. The humanitarian impact is increasing after the passage of tropical storm REMAL which made landfall near the Bangladesh-India border and crossed north-eastern India on 26-28 May. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), as of 29 May, in Bangladesh 16 people died, 807,023 people have been evacuated to 9,424 evacuation centres and almost 3.5 million people have been affected. In addition, 40,246 houses were completely damaged, and 131,678 others were partially damaged. The rain and high tides damaged some embankments and flooded coastal areas in the Sundarbans. Rain brought by the cyclone, flooded roads also in the capital Dhaka. In India, media report at least 37 fatalities, most of them in Mizoram State, dozens missing people, and hundreds of evacuated. The worst affected states are Mizoram, West Bengal, Assam, and Meghalaya. Tropical storm REMAL struck northeastern India and Bangladesh from May 26-28, causing severe flooding and landslides. In India\\'s northeast, 39 people were reported dead, with the highest fatalities in Mizoram. Dozens remain missing, over 500 were injured, and significant displacement has occurred, with nearly 21,000 affected and 175 homes damaged across Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Tripura. In Manipur, the storm impacted around 188,143 people and damaged over 24,000 houses. West Bengal\\'s South 24 Parganas district saw 1.9 million people affected, thousands of homes damaged, and over 150,000 people evacuated to relief camps. Further assessments are pending. In Bangladesh, the cyclone\\'s aftermath left 16 dead and affected 3.75 million people, according to Save the Children. Approximately 150,000 homes were hit, affecting 639,000 people, including many children. In India, 10 days after the cyclone Remal made a landfall, there has been random episodes of unseasonal rainfall in the affected area. As per media reports 07 people have lost their lives and nearly 100 people have been injured as a consequence of the cyclone. People continue to live in damaged and uninhabitable conditions with unusable toilet facility conditions. Some local donor agencies have supported with tarpaulin sheets which is providing temporary relief. There were more than 1,400 relief camps functional during the cyclone, now they have been closed and people have returned to their homes, many of which have been partially or completely destroyed. As per government reports from the district of South 24 Parganas, 23 blocks, 249 Gram Panchayats (village level government administration), 1,905,032 people are affected. Government has distributed 70,914 tarpaulins and 153,353 fresh cooked meals to the impacted people. In Bangladesh, according to the Department of Disaster Management (DDM), under the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), about 4.6 million people were affected by Cyclone Remal in 19 districts, and 16 people died across seven districts. Approximately 807,023 people were evacuated to 9,424 evacuation shelters across 19 districts. Over 173,000 houses were damaged, including 40,338 that were completely uninhabitable. About 80,591 hectares of cultivable land were inundated. Additionally, 50,000 fish enclosures, 34,000 ponds, and 4,000 crab farms were severely flooded, disrupting food supply chains, and exacerbating livelihoods and food insecurity. More than 530,000 farmers have been affected by damage to crops worth BDT 10,595 million (USD 90.7 million). Bangladesh has recently undergone civil unrest and turmoil, compounding the already existing humanitarian situation that resulted from the recent Cyclone Remal and the floods in the northeastern parts of the country. The situation has impacted the well-being and lives of millions of children, women, and the entire population. Response efforts are being hindered by disrupted logistics, communication breakdowns, and coordination issues, leading to delays in delivering water and essential supplies such water purification tablets, education in emergency kits (EIE kits) and dignity kits. Violence and unrest resulted in roadblocks and curfews, restricting access to affected areas and delaying the provision of emergency services. The safety of humanitarian workers is at risk, further limiting their ability to assist, while increased anxiety, fear and mental stress have reduced attendance at awareness sessions and impacted health services seeking by communities. By September 2024, a total of 18.4 million people in Bangladesh have been impacted by cyclone Remal and recurrent floods, leaving an estimated 6.4 million in need of immediate assistance in 29 districts, which accounts for 45 per cent of the 64 total districts. Six months after Cyclone Remal made landfall, the most vulnerable families in Bangladesh continue to struggle to recover from its impacts. In the worst-affected areas, many people are still living in damaged homes, unable to afford repairs. With the onset of winter between December and January, these families are likely to face additional hardships as they contend with cold weather.

The flood also impacted roads, sub-roads, irrigation system and 100 acres of agriculture land in 16 provinces. Samangan and Herat provinces were the worst affected by devastating floods. Heavy rainfall in north-eastern Afghanistan (especially Nuristan Province) over the last 48 hours, has caused flash floods. Media report at least 60 fatalities, a number of people still missing, 200 destroyed houses, and damage to roads across the Miardish Village (Kamdesh District, eastern Nuristan Province, bordering with Pakistan). In late night of 28 July 2021, massive flash floods, triggered by heavy rain, occurred in Mirdesh village in Kamdesh district in Nuristan province – eastern part of Afghanistan. As per the initial field reports, around 150 lives are lost with 113 dead bodies found as of 31 July 2021 – others were still missing. Around 300 residential houses are impacted with 200 houses fully damaged. One public bridge and four small bridges are also damaged. The water also swept away cattle, destroyed agricultural lands and also demolished a large part of a road in Kamdesh district. On 30 August, heavy rains and floods were reported in Helgal valley, Ghazi Abad area in Sheltan, Ghazi Abad, Nari and Shigal districts in Kunar Province which inflicted damage to roads, bridges, livestock as well as farmlands. Also, 105 people reportedly were affected by flash floods in Behsud District in Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province. Since the massive flash floods in Nuristan Province that occurred in the late night of 28 July, the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) had conducted a damage and needs assessment in Kamdesh district – a remote area that was then not under government control. Based on updated figures tabulated by 1 August, in addition to the loss of more than 260 lives, nearly 30 business premises, 3 mosques, and 7 bridges were destroyed, as well as water and electricity infrastructure and over 360 hectares of agricultural land and 3,200 fruit trees. The floods risks of Nuristan remain - recently, flash flood warnings for Nuristan were also issued by the Civil Aviation Authority Meteorological Department. Coupled with the remoteness of the village and devastation from the flash floods of 28 July, the areas continue to require immediate humanitarian assistance for disaster relief and early recovery. Even though it has been more than five months since the devastating floods in early May, the situation in Afghanistan has complicated the early recovery processes of the affected communities, and environmental threats remain due to reduced coping mechanisms.

Medical assistance and preventive measures are ongoing to curb the disease which is mostly transmitted through contaminated water. The current outbreak in Niger is closely linked to an unclean water supply and hygiene and sanitation facilities for the 240,000 people who are currently displaced in Diffa. This is a particularly vulnerable population that for years has been suffering the consequences of the conflict between Boko Haram and armies in the region. To contain the outbreak, MSF has been working with the Ministry of Health for several weeks. Additionally, MSF has significantly increased its water and sanitation activities in Kitchendi, Garin Wazan and Toumour villages, where around 135,000 people have settled—the vast majority of which are displaced. The organization also distributed water chlorination tablets, soap and new jerrycans for 16,800 families in these villages. So far, more than 27,900 gallons of water have been treated and jerrycans being used in the community have been cleaned to prevent the spread of the disease. There is a risk that the outbreak will intensify. New cases are expected to continue to emerge in new health districts in the region. Diffa region is prone to rapid propagation of the disease due to the prevalent underlying factors, such as limited access to safe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices. The region is inhabited by vulnerable populations, such as refugees, IDPs, and returnees who are at risk of contracting the disease due to their living conditions. The forthcoming rainy season, from June to September, is likely to increase the spread of the disease to neighbouring regions, and will further exacerbate WASH needs among affected populations. As of mid-August, the hepatitis E outbreak in Niger is gradually improving, with a sustained decrease in the number of new cases observed since the second peak was attained in week 26, during which 150 cases were reported. During week 32 (week ending 13 August 2017), 37 new suspected cases were reported, compared with 48 in week 31. The trend of hepatitis E cases in Niger has continued to decrease steadily after the last peak in week 26 (week ending 30 June 2017), with the incidence falling below 40 cases per week. During week 39 (week ending 1 October 2017), a total of 39 new cases and zero deaths were reported, compared to 45 cases reported in week 38. All the new cases originated from Diffa District. Since the beginning of the outbreak on 2 January 2017, a total of 1,955 suspected and confirmed cases including 38 deaths (case fatality rate 1.9%) have been reported, as of 2 October 2017. The cases have been reported from five districts, including Diffa (1,216 cases, 7 deaths), Nguigmi (305 cases, 2 deaths), Bosso (244 cases, 2 deaths), Mainé Soroa (11 cases), and Goudoumaria (9 cases). Diffa and Bosso have been the most affected districts, accounting for over 90% of the total cases. The last death occurred on 7 July 2017. New cases of Hepatitis E are still being presented and recorded in the region of Diffa.

The incident occurred in the town known as \\\\\"El Cayo\\\\\", the main population center of the municipality and where the municipal offices, health center, banks, and other commercial and government buildings are located. To date, the causes of the fire are still unclear. There was no Fire Department in the affected areas. Therefore, there was not a speedy response to the incident. According to reports from the Permanent Contingency Commission (COPECO), the fire was 100% controlled around 11:00 a.m. on 2 October, thanks to the deployment of firefighters from the near island of Roatan (located between the islands of Útila and Guanaja) and the regions near the coast of the country of La Ceiba and Tegucigalpa, including members of the Honduran Naval Force and Air Force, which provided boats and helicopters to quell the spread of the fire. There is a long distance, between Guanaja and the main cities; hence supporting a speedy response was not possible (Guanaja – La Ceiba 123 km, Guanaja – Tegucigalpa 299 km). Due to the proximity of the houses and wood as main construction material, the fire spread quickly, affecting approximately half of the territorial extension of El Cayo. The first reports indicated that the consequences of the event account for a total population of approximately 4,000 people broadly affected (2,500 directly affected), more than 500 evacuees, 90 homes destroyed, 136 homes damaged and 3 injured who were transferred by air to the University School Hospital located in Tegucigalpa; no deaths have been reported.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"According to preliminary reports on the ground, some shelters were set up in the sector by the Guanaja Municipal Emergency Committee.

Four people, three boys in Somaliland and a six-year-old girl in Hirshabelle State were reportedly killed; about 100 shelters for displaced people destroyed and at least 134 families (804 people) affected or displaced across Somalia. Heavy rains led to localized floodings which affected an estimated 124,155 people across Somalia as of 28 April, with more than 5,130 displaced and seven children killed, according to partners in the field. The worst affected were Jubaland, Hirshabelle and South West states. On 27 April, flash floods inundated roads connecting Dhobley and Afmadow districts and its environs in Jubaland State, temporarily making the roads impassable thereby affecting an estimated 60,000 people in the two districts. The local airstrips in Dhobley and Afmadow were flooded. Moderate rains were also reported in Middle Juba and Gedo region, notably in Doolow, Luuq, and Bualle.

At least 67 of the 95 verified settlements for internally displaced people in Hirshabelle were impacted by the rains, affecting about 39,120 people (6,520 households). The Gu (April to June) heavy rains and flash floods spread to more areas of Somalia and affected at least 203,438 people, including around 37,120 displaced or relocated and nine people killed as of 8 May, according to authorities. The floods destroyed and damaged infrastructure including some 3,080 shelters, 4,702 latrines, three schools and killed at least 100 livestock. Shallow wells were submerged and some destroyed, which in turn, posed a risk of cholera outbreak. Additionally, hectares of agricultural land were inundated by the floods, jeopardizing food security and might lead to an increase in price instability.

Humanitarian partners, working together with the Federal Government of Somalia, continued to support people affected by Gu (April to June) seasonal rains and flash floods, and reached at least 157,000 people with some form of assistance. As of 14 May, the number of people affected by the ongoing rains had risen to 225,759 people including 38,727 people displaced and 9 deaths, according to the authorities. Across Somalia, the heavy rains and flash floods have resulted in the loss of livelihoods, including livestock, cropland, damaged small businesses and destroyed infrastructure including shelter (3,367 destroyed and 870 affected), water sources (29 water points), latrines (5,002), schools (7), and damaged roads. Humanitarian agencies, the Federal Government of Somalia, Federal Member States and partners continued to provide lifesaving assistance and reached at least 201,000 people in 36 districts with unconditional cash transfers, food and non-food items, cholera prevention and awareness messages, health, protection and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) assistance. The rains affected some 268,359 people and killed 10. The number of people displaced significantly rose to 81,000 from 38,700 reported on 19 May after the Shabelle River broke its banks in Belet Weyne district, displacing 42,600 people in Koshin, Haawo taako, Buundoweye, and Howlwadaag areas. At least 9,000 of those displaced in Belet Weyne reportedly returned to their homes and another 30,000 people were expected to return in the next two weeks. Schools in Belet Weyne town re-opened. In Dhobley and Afmadow, Jubaland State, some 24,000 people who were displaced went back to their homes due to prevailing dry conditions. Meanwhile, the spill over of Tropical Storm Laly reportedly led to the drowning of eight children in Marka town, Lower Shabelle on 23 May, according to the local community.

An Emergency Response Status for drought events in the affected sub-districts was declared by the Regent of Puncak District, effective from 7 June to 7 August 2023. According to Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD District Puncak – Central Papua), some 7,500 people (1,800 families) are reportedly experiencing hunger as of 29 July. Essential aid, including food items, non-food items and emergency shelter kits have been distributed by the BPBD Puncak district authorities with support from the Indonesian National Army (TNI) and the Ministry of Social Affairs. The Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) estimates that this dry season will persist until September 2023. According to BMKG, climate phenomena recorded in Pacific Ocean waters in May and June of 2023 triggered El Niño starting June, which further causing the region to feel warmer. Anomalies in Pacific Ocean temperatures have been growing, with the index reaching 0.8, concerningly close to the threshold of 1, at which point the El Niño status goes from “Weak” to “Moderate”. Currently, trends show a consistent increase and by the end of August El Niño status kept on escalating. BMKG forecasted peak of drought season happens starting August and will last until September. Depending on the area affected, Anomalies in Pacific Ocean temperatures may prolong drought to some extent. Therefore, several areas have already impacted by the drought causing water scarcity since June or beginning of August while on the other hand rain still occurs on several area. While the drought peak is not reaching the peak yet, due to the anomalies, some area may experience drought up until October or November. Moreover, BMKG forecasts indicated a high probability that several Indonesian provinces will see rainfall intensity of around 0-20mm below normal during August and September 2023. BMKG has circulated an early warning of potential drought causing water scarcity, particularly in Java and Bali, and the southern part of Sumatra. While on the field, several areas especially in East Java, Banten and Central Java provinces, already declared drought emergency alert even before the BMKG early warning circulated and water scarcity already reported in the area. On the other hand, drought season has impacted crop production in West Papua and affecting food security in the area. Based on PMI situation reports and other resources such as social media, news and articles, water scarcity has been broadly reported. Based on secondary data review and situation at the field, there are approximately 1.2 million people affected by the drought. The number would escalate as drought will last up until September to October according to BKMG forecast. Indonesia\\'s National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) reported 1,185 disasters between July and September 2023, of which majority are drought related. This number is significantly higher compared to the same period in 2022. According to the National Food Agency (NFA), more than half of all provinces in Indonesia were considered food secure by September 2023. Out of 34 provinces, 22 provinces were categorized as stable. 12 provinces were being monitored for possible deterioration for its food security and nutrition situation, compared to 3 last year. The National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) predicted that the ongoing El Niño conditions and its resulting climate conditions over Indonesia is likely to have implications on rice planting and production, even with the regular start of rainy season in November 2023. Additionally, delayed onset of the rainy season could potentially result in reduced rice production by late 2023 and early 2024. According to BMKG, starting in March 2024, the El Niño index will continue to weaken towards a neutral level until the end of the year. Based on the modeling, more and more areas, especially the northern part of Indonesia, will start to experience rainfall or even heavy rainfall. As the phenomenon continues, rainfall, in theory, cannot be the sole indicator of the end of El Niño. Thus, further forecasts will be published based on monthly weather and climate monitoring throughout Indonesia.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"Essential aid, including food items, non-food items and emergency shelter kits have been distributed by the BPBD Puncak district authorities with support from the Indonesian National Army (TNI) and the Ministry of Social Affairs.\",\\n        \"affected_countries\": [\"Indonesia\"],\\n        \"sources\": [\"OCHA\", \"IFRC\", \"WFP\"],\\n        \"language\": \"English\"\\n    }\\n}',\n",

The compounded effects of El Niño, above-average temperatures, extreme weather events such as Tropical Storm Filipo, excessive floods, coupled with the lasting impact of past shocks such as Tropical Cyclone Freddy, are exacerbating the situation. The 2023-2024 El Niño has been one of the strongest on record, bringing below-average rainfall between October 2023 and February 2024 in southern and central Mozambique, and average to above-average rainfall to the northern part of the country. This disruption continues to impact agriculture and rural livelihoods. Between November 2023 and February 2024, typically the rainy season in Mozambique, the southern and central regions of the country experienced persistent dryness and unusually high temperatures, and many areas received less than half of their typical rainfall. These events in turn led to deteriorating vegetation conditions and crop wilting in parts of the central provinces. Around 20 million people reside in areas that have now been hit by drought, 2.7 million of whom were already struggling with food insecurity (IPC3+) before the onset of El Niño. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely to prevail from June to September 2024 in the El Niño-induced drought and conflict-affected areas of Mozambique due to poor harvests, limited income-earning opportunities, and failure to engage in normal livelihoods activities. In addition to these shocks, above-average food prices will make it difficult for poor and very poor households to access food from the markets. In Cabo Delgado, several areas receiving regular humanitarian food assistance will likely be facing Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to expand between October 2024 and January 2025, mainly in the country\\'s central region. The impact of the lean season, which includes the rapid depletion of below-average food stocks for families who were able to harvest some of their own crops, combined with above-average food prices and below average income, will lead to an expansion of areas facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes, particularly in areas affected by the El Niño-induced drought.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"DG ECHO contributed EUR 200,000 to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Emergency Appeal, aiming to support the Mozambique Red Cross in its response to the drought and food insecurity in the country.

Northern Luzon, particularly the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, and Ilocos Norte, experienced severe impacts, while Central Luzon provinces Pampanga, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija faced severe flooding and power outages. In Metro Manila, home to 13.5 million people, heavy rainfall caused urban flooding, road closures, and significant disruptions. By 10am local time, the water level in the Marikina River surpassed 18 meters, triggering mandatory evacuation of numerous families, with water levels reaching over 20.7 meters by 7pm. In one area in Quezon City, it was recorded that 458 mm of rain fell within a 24-hour period. In comparison, during Typhoon Ondoy in September 2009, the recorded rainfall over the same duration was 455 mm. Tropical cyclone Gaemi, which has intensified into a Super Typhoon, is expected to make landfall over northern Taiwan before exiting the Philippine Area of Responsibility by noon on 25 July. Moderate to intense rainfall is still expected to continue over the western portion of Luzon until 26 July according to the Philippines weather agency PAGASA. Super Typhoon Gaemi (local name Carina) has been downgraded to a typhoon as it crossed Taiwan and exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on 25 July. The storm, combined with the effects of the southwest monsoon, brought heavy rainfall to the western section of Luzon, including Metro Manila. Flooding incidents have been reported in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Due to the intense amount of rainfall, floodgates were opened for Ipo and Binga dams located in Central and Northern Luzon respectively, which further contributed to flooding incidents. In addition, La Mesa Dam, located near Metro Manila, reached its spilling level, but has since returned to normal levels. Weather is expected to improve in the coming days, but the state weather bureau PAGASA reports heavy to intense rainfall is expected over the western portion of Luzon until 27 July. Tropical cyclone GAEMI made landfall on 25 July in the mid-morning (UTC) over the eastern coast of Fujian province as a tropical storm and is expected to move north-west over the province and dissipate over the Jiangxi province on 27 July. According to the media, in China, more than 240,000 people were temporarily evacuated in the province of Fujian and more than 5,000 rescuers were deployed in the cities of Fuzhou, Putian and Ningde, and Pingtan County. In Taiwan, three people died following its passage on 24 July. In the Philippines, more than 1.3 million people have been affected (in combination with the southwest monsoon) and over 800,000 have been displaced. Tropical cyclone GAEMI affected northern Philippines (22-23 July), northern Taiwan (24 July), and southeastern China (25 July), causing casualties and damage. Taiwan reported ten fatalities, while in China 15 died in a Hunan province landslide, and 3,832 were evacuated due to a river dike breach. In the Philippines, the Department of Social Welfare and Development of the Philippines (DSWD) reports 273,757 displaced, 3,617,365 affected across 11 regions (particularly in northern Philippines) and 1,256 houses damaged or destroyed. Typhoon Gaemi has brought significant flooding and destruction across nine provinces in China, severely affecting Henan, Hunan, Jilin, Liaoning, and Yunnan provinces. In Henan Province, the typhoon resulted in the deaths of four individuals, with three others reported missing, and affected approximately 87,000 people. In Liaoning Province, more than 14,500 residents were relocated following an orange alert, indicating a high risk of severe weather. In response to the impending heavy rainfall and potential flooding, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters activated a Level-IV emergency response for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region on 29 July. To bolster local relief efforts, the Ministry of Emergency Management (MEM) deployed uncrewed aerial vehicles to Hunan Province and allocated disaster relief materials valued at 4.41 million yuan (approximately USD 618,000) to Liaoning Province. These efforts aim to assist in monitoring the situation and providing immediate relief to affected populations. The combined effects of the southwest monsoon and Tropical Cyclone Gaemi (local name Carina) have brought heavy to intense rainfall across the Philippines, affecting over 4.8 million people nationwide. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reports 39 fatalities (14 confirmed and 25 under validation), nine injuries, and six people missing. Approximately 108,000 people are currently displaced and housed in 557 evacuation centers.

In Galgadud region, heavy rains resulted in flash floods that destroyed IDPs shelters in settlements in low lying land in Abudwaq town. An estimated 9,300 displaced people in Danwadaag, Kulmiye and Wadajir settlements have been affected and an unknown number has moved to Cadaado town until flooding recedes.

In Middle Shabelle, the Shabelle River burst its banks displacing people in Horseed area. Farms and IDP shelter were washed away. Some 7,000 affected people have moved to Hantiwadaag village in Jowhar. According to partners, an estimated 13,000 have been affected by flooding. In Hiraan region, thousands of people have been affected after the Shabelle River burst its banks and its inlets overflowed into parts of Belet Weyne town and several riverine villages inundating houses and crops. Overall, more than 427,000 people have been affected as of 26 April and of these nearly 175,000 have been displaced as a result of the flash and river flooding in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region, according to data collected by humanitarian partners. Flash and river flooding has so far affected an estimated 630,000 people. More than 214,800 of these have been displaced from their homes following the heavy rains received across the country in April, according to the UNHCR-led Protection & Return Monitoring Network (PRMN). An estimated 772,500 people have been affected by the flooding and more than 229,000 are displaced, according to PRMN. According to the FEWS NET and FSNAU, the food security outcomes are likely to be more severe than previously projected for many families in areas affected by flooding, especially in riverine areas of Hirshabelle, Jubaland and some agropastoral areas of South West State. In these areas, several roads are now impassible and trade flows are expected to slow, driving food prices higher. Cases of AWD/Cholera are expected to rise as flood waters stagnate and remaining clean drinking water sources are compromised. There has been a significant reduction in rainfall levels in the Juba and Shabelle river basins in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands over the last two weeks, with most areas receiving only light rainfall, if any. According to SWALIM, the forecast for the coming week calls for clear weather, with the exception of coastal areas of Lower Shabelle and Lower Juba in Jubaland State. This signifies the gradual end of the 2018 Gu rainy season, which has seen above-average rainfall during April and early May. Some river breakages have not yet been closed in the mid-lower parts of the Shabelle river and therefore there remains a moderate risk of flooding. River levels along the Juba river have been gradually decreasing, which has reduced the risk of flood.

The monsoon rains that lashed Pakistan from the end of July through August 2010 caused the country’s worst flooding since 1929. The northwest of the country, particularly the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was the first area to be affected. The situation deteriorated with the passing weeks as flooding spread to two other major food-producing provinces, the Punjab and Sindh, both densely populated, in August and September. Out of a population of 168 million, at least 20 million people were affected by the floods, losing their homes and livelihoods, mainly across the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh. The floods also affected people in Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-Administered-Kashmir. More than 1700 people died, more than 7 million were left homeless and at least 1.8 million homes were destroyed. Over 2.4 million hectares of standing crops were submerged, and 450,000 heads of livestock lost. Within a period of one and a half months, 78 districts out of Pakistan’s 141 districts were affected, and as of 24 October 2010, the government’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported that there had been 1,985 deaths and 2,946 people injured by the floods. Out of the estimated 22.2 million hectares of agricultural land, almost two million hectares were destroyed in the floods, threatening severe food shortages in the coming months. More than 400 hospitals and health clinics were damaged or destroyed, as well as education facilities, power and transmission lines, telecommunication networks and industrial infrastructure. In Punjab, the breadbasket of Pakistan, experienced a combination of flash floods in the mountains and highly destructive river flooding in agricultural areas. An estimated six million people were affected across eleven districts. More than 500,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. And more than 1.85 million acres of arable land was washed away. The most severely affected districts were: Muzzafargarh, Rajanpur, Mianwali, R.I. Khan, Layyah, D.G. Khan, and Bhakkar. The direct impact of the floods has been the most protracted in Sindh. Close to half of the rural population was affected, with millions evacuated or forced to flee. At the peak of the crisis vast swathes of the province were left underwater, critical because the majority of the people rely on agriculture for their survival. More than seven million people were affected and more than 875,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. More than 2.5 million acres of arable land was submerged, resulting in a problem with nutrition, especially among the young. In March 2011, more than 100,000 people were still in camps or settlements.

Preliminary reports indicate flooding and wind damage as Eta continues its projected westward path over northern Nicaragua. The United States’ National Hurricane Center (NHC) projects that Eta will cross into central Honduras by midday on 4 November and then reach eastern Guatemala and Belize on 5 November at night, passing over northern El Salvador during this time, before turning north-east back out into the Caribbean Sea by 7 November. Eta has downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves into eastern and central Honduras at 11 km/h with windspeeds of 65 km/h. Despite Eta’s decreased intensity and lower windspeeds, Nicaragua continues to take on moderate, but persistent, rainfall throughout much of the country, with meteorological forecasts citing more than 600mm through 8 November. Eta’s slow movement and ongoing impact, coupled with the remote locations of areas along Nicaragua’s north-eastern Caribbean shores that have taken the brunt of Eta’s effects, are limiting full and complete evaluations. Eta is expected to continue weakening as it interacts with mountainous terrain in Nicaragua and Honduras, potentially weakening to a tropical depression by 4 November at night. Nicaragua’s National Disaster Prevention System (SINAPRED) reports that Eta, now on its way out of Nicaragua, has thus far caused two deaths due to a landslide in the mining area of Bonanza. Preliminary reports cite material damages, uprooted trees, interruptions to power supply, flooding and blocked roads and affected bridges. Official sources report that there are 30,000 people sheltered across 48 installations, including churches, schools, shelters and family homes. After almost a month since the landfall of Eta, Nicaragua estimates over 3 million people affected, as well as significant infrastructure damages in 56 municipalities, including approximately 43,000 damaged / destroyed homes. The Government response continues to focus on restoring basic service access for water, power and telecommunications. Eta’s rains are also causing flooding, damages and humanitarian impacts in Honduras, with the Permanent Commission for Contingencies (COPECO) reporting more than 3,480 people affected and 1 death as of 12:00am local time 4 November. Honduran Armed Forces report supporting the evacuation of more than 2,500 people, indicating that 1,340 are in shelters. Material damages include nearly 350 affected homes, as well as several road blockages that have cut off 41 communities. With Eta crossing into Honduras, outer band rains began falling over Guatemala in the past 24 hours, triggering flooding in several areas. Per the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED), the rains and subsequent flooding and landslides have thus far affected 27,770 people across the departments of Alta Verapaz, Petén, Quiché and Sololá. In El Salvador, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) reports that Eta is causing high winds of up to 30 km/h in parts of the capital of San Salvador that have already led to fallen trees and debris. The National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) anticipates that Eta’s major threat is heavy rainfall and flooding, with some locations across the country already taking on 50mm of rain. NEMO expects rainfall to last until 9-11 November, posing a high flood risk across Belize. In Costa Rica, the National Emergency Commission (CNE) reports that hazardous rains related to Eta have affected 79 communities, mostly in the north-western Pacific coast. CNE, who have deployed response teams to affected areas, adds that there are 500 people in 16 shelters, a number they expect to rise as persistent rainfall continues to affect the country. The National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC) reports that rains related to Eta have damaged some 213 homes in western and central Panama communities. Additionally, landslides in the north-western Ngäbe Buglé indigenous territory have affected about 1,000 people. Heavy rain due to the influence of Hurricane ETA affected the southern States of Mexico (particularly Chiapas, Tabasco and Veracruz) over the past few days, causing floods, triggering landslides and leading to casualties and damage. Three weeks after Hurricane Eta struck Central America, authorities continue assessing the damages and gathering information on the affected communities. As of 25 November, the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) reported that there were 109 families, including 258 children still in shelters.

At least 44,153 people across the aforementioned Provinces have been affected, while up to 618 houses have been partially damaged. On 17-18 May, rain with thunderstorms is forecast over Central, Sabaragamuwa, Uva, Eastern and North-Central Provinces. The southwest monsoon and activation of a depression which was later developed to tropical cyclone “Tauktae” over the southeast Arabian sea triggered heavy rainfall in Sri Lanka from 12 to 14 May 2021. Western, South and Sabaragamuawa provinces of Sri Lanka were worst affected. Sri Lanka’s Department of Meteorology has reported a maximum rainfall up to 336 millimeters in the Western province particularly in Kalutara district. During this period five deaths have been reported in Gampaha, Galle and Kegalle districts. Even though rain has stopped, the affected low-lying areas are still inundated with floods in the nine districts in five provinces and have caused damages to residential areas. Agricultural lands and standing crops have also been inundated and damaged as well as the infrastructures. Sri Lanka Metrological department predicts heavy rainfall on 22-25 May and the possibility of continuation of flooding, which may increase the impact and further exacerbate the situation with further reduction of coping capacity of vulnerable households in the affected areas. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) situation report as of 17 May, 43,701 people (11,247 families) have been affected across 9 districts, and 5 deaths were reported. In these districts, 16 houses are fully damaged, and 1,453 houses are partially damaged, and 166 facilities of small and medium enterprises have also been damaged. A total of 29 evacuation centres/Safety locations are activated and 377 families (1,658 people) are located in these centres. Eight road embankment failure incidents were reported from Kegalle District which caused two fatalities. The DMC is coordinating the national response efforts. Water sources of the area have been contaminated due to heavy rain and the overflow of sewerage pits/septic tanks are open to public water facilities. Therefore, DMC reveal that there is a need for drinking water, wells and area cleaning. Due to activation of South-West monsoon winds, very heavy rains were received during 2 June to 5 June, and most parts of the South Western region received more than 300mm rainfall within 24 hours and maximum reported was 346mm in Dummalasooriya on 3 June (Puttalam district). As a result due to heavy rainfall, strong winds and few landslides a total of 245,212 people (60,674 families) got affected in 10 districts, since 2 May. Furthermore, 14 deaths were reported, and two persons suffered minor injuries while two persons were missing due to floods and cutting failures. A total amount of 15,658 people (3,520 families) have been highly impacted and evacuated to 72 safety centres set up to assist the displaced. Most of these safety centres are in the Colombo (32), Gampaha (16), Kalutara (10) and Ratnapura (10) districts. Some 3,397 of these displaced people are residing with relatives or friends houses. Heavy rain and strong winds have been affecting parts of western Sri Lanka since 3 June, causing floods and landslides, which have resulted in casualties. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), 17 people have died, five have been injured and two others are missing. More than 66 people have been rescued from flooded areas in Gampaha and Kalutara Districts (Western Province). In addition, about 271,110 individuals have been affected by floods and landslides events, whilst 26,806 people have been displaced to 6,177 evacuation centres. Damage has been reported to about 1,000 buildings. The International Disaster Charter for floods and flash floods was activated on 5 June. Early warnings for landslide events have been issued for Western and Sabaragamuwa (southern Sri Lanka) Provinces, while on 7-8 June, heavy rain is forecast over the same Provinces. Heavy rain and strong winds continue to affect particularly western and south-western Sri Lanka, causing floods and landslides, which have resulted in an increased human impact. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), 20 people have died and five individuals remain injured. The number of total affected people stands at 176,419 and up to 7,989 individuals have been displaced to either evacuation centres or relatives\\' houses across ten Districts of Sri Lanka. Damage has been reported to more than 1,100 buildings. On 9-10 June, heavy rain is forecast over Western, Sabaragamuwa (southern Sri Lanka) and North-western Provinces. As of 11 June, floodwater receded considerably, about 90% the families have returned to either their own places or staying with host families. Since 98% houses are partially damaged people prefer to stay in their own places while working on repairs. Heavy rain and strong winds have been affecting the Central Province of Sri Lanka, causing floods and resulting in casualties and damage. According to the Disaster Management Centre of Sri Lanka, one person died and another has been injured in Kandy District. In addition, 2,113 people have been affected and 122 houses damaged across the Districts of Kandy and Nuwara Eliya.

The orange alert means that government institutions are planning for an impending disaster. Continued rainfall has been forecast for the first quarter of 2017. Rains are expected to continue, which will increase the number of people affected. The risk of vector- and water-borne diseases is particularly high, as both cholera and malaria are endemic and outbreaks recurring. In Malawi, due to La Niña weather phenomenon since the onset of the rainy season, many districts have received normal to above normal rainfall triggering flash floods in some of the districts. Between 4 and 10 February, heavy rain caused the worst flooding in Salima District in four Traditional Authorities of Ndindi, Pemba, Kambwiri and Maganga. A total of 35,304 people have been affected. 7,216 people have been displaced and are homeless and are dwelling in school blocks. On 15 February, Tropical Cyclone Dineo made landfall near Inhambane, Southern Mozambique. Shortly after, the storm evolved from severe tropical storm to Category III Tropical Cyclone and was reclassified as Ex-Dineo. The initial report indicated 3 deaths and 4 injured, damaged Infrastructure (electricity, and roads) as a result of the storm in the affected areas. The National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) projects that urban flooding in small villages and cities may affect 200,000 people over the next 7 days and the following river basins would be at risk of flooding. Between January and March 2017, Zimbabwe experienced severe flooding across 37 districts of the country, which damaged local infrastructure, livelihoods, transportation routes, and homes. Between 18 and 23 February 2017, Botswana was hit by the tropical depression, ex-Dineo which caused significant flooding across the country. As a result of inundations, bridges have collapsed, roads have been closed, and health facilities have been flooded. The Government has closed schools in some districts to reduce the risk of children drowning, however in some districts children must still travel long distances to school in sometimes hazardous flood conditions. In Namibia some 23,581 learners from schools in Omusati Region are currently idling at home as a precautionary measure taken by 67 schools that have been flooded by the incessant heavy rains that have deluged the north of Namibia in recent weeks. Apart from Omusati Region, schools in Ohangwena are also flooded with rainwater gushing into a number of classrooms.

This slow-onset disaster is unique to Mongolia and results from summer droughts followed by heavy snowfalls and extreme cold, leading to insufficient grazing pastures and hence underfed animals resulting in increased livestock mortality. As of 30th December 2023, over 90% of the country has been affected by extreme Dzud conditions, with 160 soums across 20 provinces being identified as high-risk areas. Over 258,000 people, including 100,000 children (51,000 girls and 49,000 boys) are affected due to roads blocked by snow, preventing children from accessing vital health, nutrition, education and protective services. Herder families, who are most directly impacted by the Dzud, often have to leave their children in the care of relatives or at boarding schools, increasing protection risks and causing psychological stress. As a result of the Dzud, the number of livestock losses increased from 49,000 in November 2023 to 284,242 by 26 January 2024. The Otor Movement is a nomadic practice of domestic herders migrating to seek pasture: From early November 2023, 18,859 herder families (67,892 people) have been on the Otor Movement. As of January 2024, 7,570 families moved to the state-protected area (the Mongolian government is using its last pasture resort, where settlement is prohibited because there are endangered plants and animals under State protection), 2,322 families moved to other provinces, 4,303 families moved within their province, 2,907 moved to the border, 1,047 moved to the provincial border (in and out between 2 provinces), and only 710 families moved in soum borders. While the Otor movement is beneficial for livestock, it requires tremendous efforts from herder families to frequently relocate, forcing them to live in roughly built shelters and being isolated from basic services. The intensity of the dzud is impacting those on the Otor Movement more than in previous years, and the number of people on the Otor Movement is higher than in previous years. The current white and iron dzud in Mongolia has resulted in a critical situation, with 90% of the country facing high risk. The herding communities are struggling with inadequate feed and skyrocketing feed prices, leading to heightened vulnerabilities. The increasing severity of weather conditions further exacerbates the crisis, underscoring the urgent need for humanitarian assistance and sustainable solutions to support Mongolia\\'s rural communities and traditional livelihoods. According to the national Emergency Operations Center (EOC), there are 13,573 households currently residing in snow blocked areas, as of 18 February 2024. Between November 2023 to February 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 150,500 people, including 62,500 children (31,500 girls and 31,000 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 89 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 1,430 people trapped by heavy snow. According to EOC, 9 casualties due to snowstorms, including 1 child, have been reported. The number of livestock perished reached 667,841 as of 19 February 2024, which is significantly higher compared to past years’ data. However, the peak of livestock mortality is yet to come and expected to occur from late February to April 2024. As of 22 February, media report one fatality and more than 1.5 million livestock losses across the country. Essential aids have been provided since 19 February. The livestock mortality rate reportedly reached 4.8 per cent by 29 February, representing some 3.1 million heads of livestock – nearly a million more livestock deaths than a week ago and nearly 6.5 times as many livestock deaths as this time last year. Livestock deaths are expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks, potentially exceeding the national-level 6 per cent disaster threshold. At the province (aimag) level, the most severe impacts this season have been recorded in the eastern regions, with four aimags already exceeding the threshold – Sukhbaatar (24.4 per cent), Dornogovi (14.7 per cent), Govisumber (11.2 per cent), and Hentii (9.6 per cent). With around 190,000 herder households grappling with insufficient feed, soaring prices and heightened vulnerabilities, the worsening weather conditions are exacerbating a crisis, highlighting the urgent need for support and sustainable interventions to bolster rural communities and traditional livelihoods in Mongolia. According to the Dzud Map produced by NAMEM on 26 February 2024, 76 per cent of the country is currently affected by white and ice/Iron Dzud types. Several additional key factors have contributed to the escalation of the Dzud to an exceptional level this winter: numerous blizzards since November 2023, extensive snow coverage across the country, and fluctuating temperatures with periods of intense cold/freezing, followed by warm phases/snow melting, and then refreezing, leaving no grazing options for livestock (sheep, cows, horses, and camels). Consequently, hay and fodder stocks had to be utilised a few months earlier than in usual winters. The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), established by the government of Mongolia last December, has reported a rapid increase in livestock mortality from the second half of February 2024, with the latest official figures as of 14 March 2024 indicating over 4,7 million dead animals (compared to 612,000 dead animals on 21 February). This represents 7 per cent of the national livestock (up from 0.94 per cent on 21 February). While the numbers are increasing fast, this situation is already twice as critical as last year\\'s Dzud, and the government estimates that this year will be far more severe than the worst Dzud recorded in 2010. On 14 February 2024, the Government of Mongolia passed a resolution declaring a heightened readiness level until 15 May due to the severe Dzud affecting the country nationwide (priority support and involvement in crisis management, at all governmental levels). According to EOC figures, as of the end of February, 185,937 herder households, constituting 75 per cent of all herder households, have been directly or indirectly affected by the Dzud’s impacts. About 100,000 herder families are considered the most vulnerable households. As of 7 March 2024, 1,344 herders have lost their entire livestock, and 18,859 herder families are currently on the Otor movement (a nomadic winter coping mechanism used in past years by herder communities in Mongolia to provide livestock access to pasture). Between November 2023 and March 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 114 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 3,757 people, including 721 children, trapped by heavy snow. The situation has escalated significantly compared to previous years, with March 2024 witnessing conditions twice as severe as the last dzud event, and the worst since 2010. Current livestock mortality rates have already soared to 8.1% of 64.7 million livestock, with 2,257 herder households having lost more than 70% of their livestock. The severity of the situation has prompted a revision of the Dzud Response Plan for 2023/2024, which complements the Government of Mongolia’s planned response. The plan revised by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) now aims to deliver immediate and life-saving assistance to 76,000 people out of the 200,000 people in need identified by the HCT through a coordinated approach with early warning and early action to respond to needs triggered by the Dzud. Health concerns are escalating, with restricted food availability leading to nutritional deficiencies among herder households. The remote location of many herder families, combined with a lack of fuel and prioritization of livestock over healthcare, severely limits access to medical services, which are available at the provincial and soum levels. The need to dispose of more than five million animal carcasses is urgent, as yellow floods are expected with spring temperatures set to melt an exceptional amount of snow this year. The government has begun to safely bury animal carcasses through collection points along roads, with areas near rivers being prioritized to contain public health risks. Between November 2023 and April 2024, Mongolia experienced the harshest dzud in the last fifty years, with severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affecting over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys). Twenty people, including two children, have lost their lives due to severe blizzard. The dzud has mostly affected herder households, whose main/sole income source for livelihood is livestock. As of 25 April 2024, 4957 herder households had lost more than 70 per cent of their livestock and the country has lost 7.1 million livestock, amounting to 11.1 per cent of the total. Despite the temperature beginning to rise and the spring months ahead, dzud conditions persist and the loss of livestock is expected to continue in the coming months. Although the severe winter condition subsided, livestock that had been exhausted and starved for long period continued to perish well into May. By mid-May 2024, the number of livestock loss reached 7.2 million, amounting to 11.6 percent of the total. The impact of the dzud impact on the herder households continues to affect the livelihood, mental health, wellbeing, nutritional and education needs of over 24,000 children. Amid the dzud recovery efforts, there is a high risk of flooding in central and eastern parts of Mongolia, posing increasing challenges for the vulnerable population in flood-prone areas. Official estimates indicate that about 7.9 million heads of livestock perished due to the 2023/24 Dzud, with the highest losses occurring in Sukhbaatar, Khentii, Arkhangai, Tuv and Dornogovi provinces (locally known as aimags) located in the eastern and central parts of the country. The death toll accounts for 12.3 percent of the national herd, significantly exceeding the average mortality rate recorded during the same period in the previous five years and is the highest level since 2010. The loss of livestock has a direct negative effect on the income of a large number of people in the country as over a quarter of the total population is engaged in livestock‑rearing activities. Reduced income and high prices of staple foods are expected to erode the purchasing power of most vulnerable herder households, constraining their access to food. In addition to the Dzud impacts, the Emergency Operation Center (EOC) addressed the high risk of “yellow” floods due to accumulated snowfall and livestock carcasses in Dzud-affected regions by the end of May 2024. However, NAMEM issued warning for potential floods during summertime from high precipitation levels forecasted. From June to August 2024, heavy rains and floods affected several Dzud-affected regions including Uvurkhangai, Tuv, Zavkhan, and Umnugobi, directly and indirectly impacting over 1,300 people and leading to the loss of 22,000 livestock. Furthermore, a series of wildfire struck the region most affected by the dzud including Khentii, Dornod, Sukhbaatar provinces between 11-16 October, directly affecting 21 families, resulting in the loss of two children and 1,000 livestock, and burning 16 hectares of pastureland. These recurring hazards continue to compound the difficulties faced by Dzud-affected herder communities. As of 25 October, NAMEM has issued seasonal weather forecasts for October 2024 to January 2025 and MoFALI has updated pasture carrying capacity estimates and September update on the winter preparation for 2024/2025. According to NAMEM forecast, the temperatures may fluctuate between October, November, December 2024, and January 2025, with warmer conditions anticipated for October and November but colder-than-average temperatures predicted for December 2024 and January 2025, raising concerns for a possible ice/iron Dzud situation.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 89 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 1,430 people trapped by heavy snow.

Malawi, which now has an estimated 3.3 million people in Crisis or Emergency (IPC phase 3 and 4), and Zimbabwe, where nearly 2.4 million people are in Crisis or Emergency, have the highest numbers of severely food insecure people in the region. Meanwhile, three districts in Zimbabwe and two districts in Madagascar were classified in Emergency (IPC phase 4) at the outset of the lean season, as a result of extreme loss of livelihood assets. There are also pockets of people facing Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4) in Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique. Since the start of the 2018/19 cropping season in October, anomalous dry conditions have developed across parts of Southern Africa, with more intense moisture deficits registered in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, in addition to the western parts of Madagascar. Although there are a few months remaining in the cropping season, with the main harvest period usually commencing in April, the impact of the reduced rains is expected to have caused a contraction in the area planted and lowered yield prospects, particularly in the aforementioned areas. Heavier rainfall since mid‑December provided some respite and helped to alleviate moisture deficits, but concurrently resulted in localized flooding in parts of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Approximately 10.8 million people were facing severe food insecurity in Southern Africa as 2018 came to an end. In Eswatini, the estimated number of people facing Crisis (IPC phase 3) or worse food insecurity more than doubled from 120,000 in October to nearly 250,000 in December. In Zimbabwe, where 2.4 million people in rural areas were severely food insecure, the deteriorating economic situation caused sharp price increases and hampered access to food and agricultural inputs. Shortages of basic food commodities in formal markets, including cooking oil, sugar and bread, were reported, especially in remote areas. In Mozambique, more than 1.78 million people were in IPC phase 3 or above across the country, of whom 814,000 people in five provinces were prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance. Further attacks by non-state armed actors were reported in Cabo Delgado province in November, increasing food security and malnutrition concerns. Meanwhile, in Madagascar, a Flash Appeal was launched to galvanize funding for rapid response in the Grand Sud region, where 890,000 people are severely food insecure. FEWS NET anticipates the next lean season will most likely start atypically early in August/September in several areas of the region, and households will have limited purchasing power due to lower incomes. Additionally, household access to milk will be lower than normal driven by poor livestock body conditions. Consequently, atypically high levels of acute food insecurity are likely during the 2019/20 lean season in most countries across the region, except in Madagascar, Malawi, and northern Mozambique. Atypically high needs will also be driven by conflict in DRC and poor macroeconomic conditions in Zimbabwe. Although outcomes are not expected to be as severe as those following the 2015/16 drought, humanitarian partners should prepare for a likely earlier than normal start to the 2019/20 lean season and higher than normal food assistance needs during this time. President Hage Geingob [of Namibia] yesterday declared the current drought affecting 23 arid and semi-arid counties and pockets of other areas a national disaster. Since 2013, most parts of Namibia recorded below normal rainfall, thereby leaving the grazing land exhausted and with little recovery. An estimated 41.2 million people in 13 SADC Member States are food insecure this year. When comparing the 11 Member States that provided data last year, food insecurity increased by 28%. It is also 7.4% higher than it was during the severe El Niño-induced drought of 2016/17. The overall food security situation in the region is deteriorating and the number of severely food insecure people is rising in some countries, reaching a peak between October 2019 and March 2020. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes prevail in cyclone affected areas of Mozambique and Zimbabwe and areas significantly affected by the drought and the deteriorating macro-economic context in Zimbabwe. Emergency (IPC 4) outcomes prevail in parts of Southern Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique and Eswatini. Poor crop performance due to variable and late rainfall affected significant portions of Lesotho, Eswatini, southern Madagascar, and southern Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, while the impact of cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused damage and destruction to harvests in eastern Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, and central and north Mozambique. A record 45 million people across the 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) will be severely food insecure in the next six months, United Nations food agencies have warned. There are more than 11 million people now experiencing “crisis” or “emergency” levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4 in nine Southern African countries: Angola, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, Eswatini and Lesotho. The UN food agencies are escalating their responses across the nine countries, planning to assist more than 11 million people by mid-2020. In addition to addressing urgent food and nutrition needs, they will help smallholder farmers boost production and reduce losses, manage precious soil and water resources in a sustainable way and embrace climate-smart agricultural practices, better access to inputs, credit and markets, and spearhead vaccination campaigns to contain livestock disease. The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has welcomed a US$3.39 million contribution from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to help meet the immediate food needs of drought-affected people in Zambia. The US support, confirmed in December 2019, comes at a moment of increasing needs, after drought and prolonged dry spells have left 2.3 million people severely food insecure and in need of assistance. Through this funding, WFP will deliver 2,380 MT of pulses to complement the Government’s maize for three months, giving 255,000 drought-affected people across the country the food and nutritional assistance they need. A record 45 million Southern Africans are food insecure as the region enters the peak of the lean season (January-March 2020). Between October 2019 and March 2020, an estimated 430,000 people are facing severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3+) and require urgent humanitarian action. More than 4.34 million people in rural Zimbabwe are acutely food insecure facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse from February-June 2020. That is equivalent to 45% of the country’s rural population. This includes over 1.04 million people facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity, with Hwange, Kariba and Binga districts being the most vulnerable. According to the results of the IPC, around 26% of Lesotho’s population (380,000 people) are facing high food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) and above from July to September 2020 and require urgent humanitarian action. This includes around 33,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 350,000 people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). In the current period, seven districts are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3) with the exception of Butha-Buthe, Leribe and Berea, where around 560,000 people are classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and require support to maintain their livelihoods. Between October 2020 and March 2021, Zambia’s food security situation is expected to deteriorate, as this coincides with the lean season, when more households will rely on the market for food. It is projected that about 1.98 million people (29% of the analysed population) will be facing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. By the end of the year, severe food insecurity was affecting 13.6 million people across 11 countries, and this will rise during the lean season (January to March 2021). In the Grand Sud of Madagascar, over 900,000 people faced severe food insecurity from October to December due to back-to-back droughts, compounded by COVID-19 and displacements due to the growing insecurity related to cattle raiding. Hunger will increase and affect 1.14 million from January to April 2021. In Mozambique, conflict in Cabo Delgado Province—which had displaced more than 500,000 people by end-October—and drought in the semi-arid southern and central areas of the country drove Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of food insecurity. In Zimbabwe, 2.6 million people were severely food insecure from October to December 2020 due to the prevailing economic situation and erratic rainfall, and 3.4 million people are projected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) from January to March 2021. Without the humanitarian assistance delivered in Zimbabwe in 2020, these figures would be much higher, according to the IPC analysis. According to the acute food insecurity analysis update in Zambia for the February-March 2021 projection period, an estimated 1.73 million people (25% of the analysed population) are likely to face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). This includes around 1.5 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and around 240,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), who will require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods. Around 27.3 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), making the central African country the host of the highest number of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in the world. Angola has been experiencing episodes of drought since December last year with below average rainfall in the provinces of Cuanza Sul, Benguela, Huambo, Namibe and Huíla. The situation is not expected to improve in the coming months in the absence of above average rainfall. Since the beginning of March 2021, Angolans living in the border provinces of Cunene and Huila are crossing into Namibia at illegal entry points in Omusati and Ohangwena regions in search of food, water, medical services and employment opportunities. The regional councils (local authorities) have recorded altogether 894 people in Omusati and Kunene regions who have crossed into Namibia in search of food. Mozambique: In the 16 analysis units analysed in Cabo Delgado Province, in total, it is estimated that about 75,000 children aged 6-59 months are suffering and are likely to suffer from acute malnutrition in the next 12 months and, consequently, need and will need treatment. In terms of severity of the situation, for the period October 2020 to March 2021, corresponding to the season when the survey was conducted (February 2021), eight districts and two IDP centres were classified in Alert (IPC AMN Phase 2), five districts and one IDP centre were classified in Acceptable (IPC AMN Phase 1). Projection analyses of the situation indicate, that for the period April to September 2021, in districts with limited or no humanitarian access, by the end of the projection period, the situation is likely to deteriorate to Critical (IPC AMN Phase 4) in one district, to Serious (IPC AMN Phase 3) in three districts, and to Alert in four districts. Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes are widespread across much of southern Madagascar, with some households experiencing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and worst-affected households in Ambovombe and Amboasary experiencing Catastrophe ((IPC Phase 5). Minimal seasonal improvement in food access is expected in southern Madagascar due to the expected limited harvest and associated income-earning opportunities. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes with some households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) are expected to persist through at least September. Conflict continues at relatively high levels in Cabo Delgado Mozambique and parts of the DRCongo. According to OCHA, as of April, over 732,000 people were displaced in Cabo Delgado. In Kasai, DRCongo, in March, about 41,000 were displaced due to conflict. Additionally, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, recent conflict has resulted in the government’s declaration of martial law. Conflict in DRC and Mozambique has disrupted agricultural and most typical livelihood activities with minimal seasonal improvements expected with the harvest. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected in these areas through at least September. As the harvest continues across most of the region, most households, including the poor, are consuming foods from their own production. Overall, households in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Lesotho, and most parts of Mozambique are anticipated to experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Minimal (IPC Phase 1) through at least September. In areas where Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes, while the harvest is expected to facilitate improved food access, household income will most likely remain below average. Millions of people in southern Angola are facing an existential threat as drought aggravated by climate change continues to ravage the region, Amnesty International said today. The organization highlighted how the creation of commercial cattle ranches on community land has driven pastoralist communities from their land since the end of the civil war in 2002 - a shift which left huge sections of the population food insecure and paved the way for a humanitarian crisis as the acute drought persists for over three years when drought struck over three years ago. As food and water grow increasingly scarce, thousands have fled their homes and sought refuge in neighbouring Namibia. The latest IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis results indicate that between July and September 2021, about 1.18 million people in Zambia are facing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Flooding, high maize prices, and pests drive the country’s acute food insecurity despite a good harvest. The highly food insecure population requires urgent humanitarian assistance to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. The situation has particularly deteriorated in the Western province, where five districts were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Over 1 million people in Malawi are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase between July and September 2021. Despite Malawi’s record high maize production of 46% above the five-year average, some pockets in these districts and cities experienced severe dry spells and earlier than normal tailing of rainfall. This led to localized production shortfalls coupled with the impact of COVID-19 on remittances, petty trade and self-employment activities. The population experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity require urgent action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. Around 3.6 million people are classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2), experiencing a mild level of food insecurity, while 14.1 million people are food secure-- Minimal (IPC Phase 1). All the four urban zones analyzed (Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mzuzu, Zomba) are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) while the rural areas are in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) – 16 areas out of the 28 analyzed - or in IPC Phase 1 (none/minimal). The worst drought in the last 40 years and rising food prices have resulted in high acute food insecurity in the Cunene, Huila and Namibe provinces of South-Western Angola. An IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis of 17 municipalities of Southern Angola found that, between July and September 2021, around 1.32 million people (49% of the analysed population) have experienced high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), of which 38% are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 12% in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). These people face difficulties in accessing food or are only able to meet the minimum food requirements through crisis and/or emergency coping strategies. Between October 2021 and March 2022, the number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above is expected to rise to around 1.58 million people (58% of the analysed population), of which 42% are likely in IPC Phase 3 and 15% in IPC Phase 4. Three of the municipalities are also expected to move to a worse phase (Chicomba, Moçâmedes and Tômbua). Around 27 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) between September and December 2021, of which around 6.1 million people are experiencing critical levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 4). The country has the largest number of highly food insecure people in the world. This food insecurity is a result of a combination of conflict, economic decline, high food prices and the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis issued in September 2021 and covering the period from July to September 2021, about 1.18 million people in Zambia were facing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) with 77,938 people being most affected in Luapula, Lusaka and Western provinces. For the current period (November 2021 to March 2022), which coincides with the lean season, approximately 1.9 million people are estimated to be in high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) in the urban and rural areas of Mozambique that were analysed, and are in need of humanitarian assistance. Of these, 71% (1.32 million people) are in the four provinces of Cabo Delgado, Niassa, Nampula and Zambézia, where many of the country’s Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are concentrated. One district of Tete (Changara), one of Manica (Tambara) and three of Gaza (Chibuto, Mabalane and Guijá) are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). An estimated 7.3 million people in Angola are facing food and nutrition insecurity due to climate shocks. An estimated 3.9 million children are in need of assistance. Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) admissions among children 6 to 59 months at mid-year 2021 have already exceeded the 2020 total caseload. An estimated 1.2 million people are facing water scarcity as a direct consequence of the drought and have had their water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions compromised by COVID-19. Malawi: In the current period of November 2021 to December 2021, about 1.4 million people (7% of the population) are estimated to be experiencing Crisis levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) and require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. Around 4.4 million people are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) while 13.1 million people are food secure (IPC Phase 1). Out of all rural districts, district towns and cities analysed, 26 areas are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) while six are classified in IPC Phase 1 (Minimal). No areas are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Out of the 1.4 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), around 186,000 are from urban areas (Mzuzu, Lilongwe, Zomba and Blantyre cities), representing 8% of the urban population, whilst the remaining 1.2 million people are from the rural areas and the Bomas, representing 7% of the rural and Boma population. Overall, there is concern for the 2021/22 season as rainfall through mid-December has been significantly below average across Madagascar, Malawi, central and northern Mozambique, and northwestern Zimbabwe. Across these areas, drought conditions are ongoing to start the season. Land preparation activities are delayed, and planting has yet to begin across many areas as of November. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are ongoing across rainfall deficit areas and areas of northern Mozambique and eastern DRC impacted by continued conflict. Humanitarian assistance in southern Madagascar and Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique is improving household food consumption, where Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) and Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes are ongoing, respectively. Between December 2021 and March 2022, around 336,000 people (29% of the population in Eswatini) are estimated to be facing high acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 Crisis or above) and require urgent humanitarian assistance. Of this population, 286,000 people are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 50,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). An additional 376,000 are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) and require livelihood support. Compared to the October 2021 - March 2022 projection period from the August 2021 analysis, this update shows a slight deterioration, with a slight increase in the food insecure population in IPC Phase 3 or above in all livelihood zones except for Highveld Cattle and Maize, Timber Highlands and Moist Middleveld, with the latter two having 47% of their households having food stocks lasting more than six months. This update has seen the population projected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above increase by 19,000 people. Tanzania: For the current period of analysis (November 2021 - April 2022), about 437,000 people, representing 13% of an analysed population of 3.4 million, are estimated to be experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). Overall, an estimated 22,000 people (1% of the population analysed) are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and around 415,000 people (12% of the population analysed) in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Around 785,000 people (23% of the population analysed) are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed). Amongst the 14 councils of Tanzania analysed (12 district councils [DCs] and the rural parts of two town councils [TCs]), four councils (Handeni DC, Longido, Mkinga, and Monduli) are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), with 20% to 30% of their population experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (Phase 3 or above). The rest of the councils are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed). Approximately 5.4 million people in Malawi living in rural and secondary urban centres are facing Moderate or Severe chronic food insecurity (IPC CFI Levels 3 and 4) due to abject poverty and recurrent shocks, among other drivers. The February Malawi IPC Chronic Food Insecurity (CFI) analysis found that an additional estimated 4.4 million people face Mild food insecurity, whilst approximately 6.9 million people face No/Minimal chronic food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity in Malawi, where over 70% of the population of about 19.1 million people is living below the international poverty line of $1.90/day, is driven by abject poverty, recurrent shocks, poor policies and implementation as well as reliance on weak livelihood strategies.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"The UN food agencies are escalating their responses across the nine countries, planning to assist more than 11 million people by mid-2020.

Initial assessments indicate that as many as 100 people have been killed across eight villages in Zindajan Province, Herat Province – Mahal Wardkah (20), Dasht Hows (15), Bahadorzai (14), Zoryan (13), Koshkak (12), Sar Boland (11), Sanjab (8), and Hilalzai (7), with a further 500 people injured. Aftershocks continue to be felt two days after a 6.3 magnitude earthquake rocked Herat Province, western Afghanistan. To date, it is estimated 12,110 people (1,730 families) have been affected by the earthquake across five districts of Herat Province — Gulran (95 families), Injil (150 families), Khosan (60 families), Kushk (Robat-e-Sangai) (30 families) and Zindajan (1,395 families). The number of affected households is expected to rise as assessments are continuing in Gulran, Injil, Khosan and Kushk districts. The epicentre of the earthquake – Zindajan district – is the worst-affected area with 1,294 deaths, 1,688 injuries and 100 percent of homes destroyed. A further 485 people (191 men and 294 women) are reported to be missing. An aftershock of 5.1 M has been recorded in the affected area (37 km north-northwest of Herat City) on 10 October at 13.30 UTC. A new 6.3 M earthquake at a depth of 9 km, followed by two aftershocks of 5 M and 4.1 M, hit Herat Province on 11 October at 00:41 UTC (05:11 local time). The 6.3 M earthquake was located in Zinda Jan District, 27 km northwest of Herat City and at 14 km south-east of the 6.3 M earthquake that occurred on 7 October that caused more than 2,400 fatalities, as of 10 October. According to USGS, approximately 4,000 people were exposed to severe shaking and 1,273 million people were exposed to strong and very strong shaking. Media reports, as of 11 October, 80 injured people that have been hospitalized while rescue operation are still ongoing throughout the region for the 11 October earthquake. After the recent 6.3 M earthquake that occurred on 11 October in Herat Province, one person died and 140 people have been injured, all in Herat City and Injil District, as reported by UN OCHA. Several villages across the Districts of Gulran, Injil and Kush sustained damage following the earthquake. In addition, following previous seismic events since 7 October, at least 2,400 people have died, several hundred are reported missing, 1,714 houses have been destroyed, and 11,066 people have been affected across four districts. According to UNITAR-UNOSAT, 15 settlements have been destroyed, three severely affected and 38 moderately affected. To date, 1,384 people (759 females and 625 males) are reported to have been killed and 1,853 people injured (1,137 females and 716 males) by the earthquakes. Women and children are overly represented within reported casualties. Assessments completed to date indicate that 3,067 homes have been affected across Zindajan, Injil, Kushk / Rabat-e-Sangai, Ghulan, Herat and Khosan districts, including 2,499 which have been completely destroyed, 363 which have been severely damaged and 250 which have been moderately damaged. More than three quarters of homes destroyed are located in two districts – Zinjadin (1,353) and Injil districts (586). Additionally, 21,300 buildings are estimated to have sustained damage. On 15 October, areas north-east of Herat City were hit by a 6.3 magnitude earthquake, the third in a week to strike communities in Herat Province. Two people were reportedly killed and more than 150 people injured. Casualty numbers are not expected to rise significantly as many people are already living in the open out of fear their homes will collapse. Humanitarian facilities, residences and office spaces have sustained damage of varying severity, with engineering assessments a critical priority to differentiate between cosmetic and structural damage, and to allow traumatized residents to return to their homes. To date, 43,395 people (7,165 families) are reported to have been directly affected by the recent earthquakes across Injil (23,053 people), Kushk / Rabat-e-Sangai (8,541 people), Zindajan (7,523 people), Gulran (3,428 people), Herat (717 people) and Kohsan (133 people) districts. Injil is the worst affected district, accounting for 53 per cent of people affected. More than 3,330 homes are also reported to have been completely destroyed – the majority in Zindajan district – 2,137 homes severely damaged, and 1,697 homes moderately damaged. A scale-up of response activities is underway to provide humanitarian support to communities in Herat Province, Western Afghanistan in the aftermath of a sequence of shallow, powerful earthquakes with magnitudes exceeding 6.0, accompanied by recurring aftershocks since 7 October 2023. Assessments completed to date indicate that more than 21,500 homes have been completely destroyed (8,429) – mostly in Herat, Injil and Zindajan districts – and severely damaged (17,088) in the earthquakes, affecting around 154,000 people. With temperatures already dropping ahead of the onset of winter, affected communities will also be in need of sustainable solutions to withstand harsh conditions with urgently needed assistance to restore and reconstruct homes and shelters, and reestablish livelihoods. Latest assessments show that the first two earthquakes on 7 and 11 October left 1,480 people dead and 1,950 wounded, with available satellite imagery indicating that 513 villages were impacted, and assessments ongoing. To date, nearly 43,400 people across six districts are reported to be directly affected by the recent earthquakes, with Injil and Zindajan districts worst affected. More than half of all earthquake-affected people are in Injil, with the majority of the more than 3,330 destroyed homes assessed to date located in Zindajan. Schools, health facilities, and other infrastructure also impacted by the earthquakes, with 21,300 buildings estimated to have sustained damage. Following the earthquakes, families are living in the open, in makeshift shelters, or in informal settlement sites, leaving them vulnerable to weather, health and other protection hazards. The recent series of earthquakes has left a profound impact on a substantial number of families and individuals in the affected districts. A total of 48,347 families, comprising 275,256 people, were directly affected by these seismic events. The 382 villages are situated in the districts of Herat, Injil, Kushk, Zindajan, Gulran, Guzara, Ghoryan, Karukh, and Kohsan in Herat Province. The devastation caused by these earthquakes has been substantial, with 10,002 houses completely destroyed, 20,430 houses with severe damage, and 17,588 houses with moderate damage. As a result, a significant portion of the affected population, approximately 37,139 families, are now forced to live in makeshift tents and open spaces, while 1,268 families reside in informal settlements, and another 8,801 families have resorted to tent shelters as temporary solutions. More than two months on from the first of three devastating 6.3 magnitude earthquakes in Herat Province, western Afghanistan, humanitarian actors have reached 266,800 affected people with direct assistance. Assistance provided to affected communities to date includes emergency shelter (tents) to 16,169 households, US $5.1 million in multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA) to 19,652 households—almost 5,961 received the full MPCA package ($340 per household) and 4,310 the half MPCA package ($170). Additionally, 21,017 families have received non-food items, 13,101 families winter blankets and 11,782 families shelter repair kits. Emergency food assistance has also been provided to 110,033 people, livestock support to 853 people, nutritious foods to almost 64,512 boys and girls under five years old and essential primary healthcare to 60,256 people. Under protection, dignity kits have been provided to more than 11,822 women and girls, child-friendly space activities to 9,494 children and psycho-social support to 14,045 individuals, among other activities. One-third of all earthquakes affected people are in Injil, with more than 3,330 destroyed homes located in Zindajan. Approximately 37,139 families now reside in makeshift tents, open spaces, damaged shelters, 8,801 families are in tents and 1,268 families are residing in informal settlements. Notable needs for persons with specific needs, including 17,358 pregnant women, 17,146 infants, 3,976 individuals living with severe disabilities, 3,207 vulnerable elderly families, 3,139 unaccompanied children, 6,806 female headed households and 3,176 people chronically ill have been identified. These events have also resulted in extensive damage to vital water and sanitation facilities. The field data collection exercise for the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) for the Herat Earthquake was undertaken during the month. UNICEF lead the Education and WASH sectors as well as provided technical support in the Health and Nutrition sector. Preliminary results from the PDNA highlight that the most affected sectors in terms of aggregate damage and loss are housing, education, agriculture, livestock and minor irrigation, and transportation. The most affected districts include Herat, Injil, and Zindajan. Reconstruction and recovery needs for the nine assessed districts are estimated at US$ 383.9 million, with needs for one year, two to three years, and over three to five years estimated at US$ 154.5 million, US$ 190 million, and US$ 39.3 million, respectively. Although 85 days have passed since the earthquakes, many survivors and victims still live in makeshift tents and temporary shelters, with the situation remaining precarious. On December 28, a mild earthquake was reported in Herat Province. Most of the displaced individuals are grappling with various health issues, including trauma and mental health disorders. WHO and Health Cluster partners have been expanding efforts to provide healthcare assistance to the 220,000 affected individuals, including 1,900 female-headed households. By the end of December 2023, 102,655 individuals were provided with humanitarian health assistance. Despite these efforts, a significant funding gap persists. The Health Cluster has appealed for US$12.7 million to sustain these initiatives through March 2024, but only US$5.2 million has been received thus far. Following the earthquakes of 7 October 2023, the IFRC Secretariat dispatched emergency shelter and household items, allocated CHF 750,000 from the IFRC Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the ARCS immediate response. Additionally, the Emergency Appeal MDRAF007 was relaunched to incorporate immediate and recovery needs arising from the earthquakes. The latest revision of the Emergency Appeal includes a funding requirement of CHF 9 million for the Herat earthquake response.

Malnutrition rates are almost double from last year in at least one health center visited by DG ECHO in May 2022. Communities report the depletion of livestock assets, loss of body mass index, and lack of milk production followed by death of livestock. According to the latest IPC, approximately 13% of the population (132,000 people) is facing acute food insecurity (IPC3) and is in need of immediate assistance. Projections indicate an increase in food insecurity to 16% of the population by December 2022. IPC projections for July to December 2022 indicate an increase in the number of acutely food insecure people, likely reaching 192,168 people, representing 16% of analysed population (1.2 million people, which is about the entire country). The number of people in emergency (IPC 4) will likely increase 12,390 people, a 250% rise from the current numbers, while the 179,778 people could be in crisis (IPC 3). Current IPC analysis for the period of March to June 2022, highlight that approximately 132,000 people, representing 11% of the analysed population (of nearly 1.2 million people), are estimated to be acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 3 and 4). More precisely, an estimated 5,000 people (less than one percent of the population analysed) are estimated to already be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and approximately 127,000 people (11% of the population analysed) are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), about 285,000 people are estimated to face severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 [Crisis] and IPC Phase 4 [Emergency]) in the July‑December 2023 period. This figure, which includes about 185,000 people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 100,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), amounts to about one‑quarter of the country’s population and it is almost 50 percent higher on a yearly basis. The high prevalence and severity of acute food insecurity and the deterioration of the food security situation are mainly due to the lingering impact of a prolonged and severe drought, which affected livelihoods between late 2020 and early 2023, and resulted in a reduction of livestock numbers by about 50 percent due to widespread deaths, severely constraining incomes and availability of livestock products for pastoralist households.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"Immediate assistance is needed for approximately 13% of the population facing acute food insecurity.

The rain totals in parts of Jeseník exceeded 500 mm (20 inches), surpassing previous flood records. Roads, railways, and bridges suffered extensive damage, especially in Ostrava, where train services were suspended. These regions experienced severe flooding, leading to the destruction of homes and infrastructure. Thousands of people were evacuated, and approximately 250,000 were left without electricity. The situation remains critical in parts of the South Bohemian Region, where ongoing threats of further flooding persist. As of 19 September, five fatalities were reported, along with widespread displacement of about 10,000 residents. Heavy rains brought by Storm Boris have caused severe flooding in southwestern Poland, particularly affecting the voivodeships of Dolnoslaskie, Opolskie, Slaskie, and Malopolskie. Rivers like the Morawka have overflowed, and some dams have collapsed, leading to widespread flooding. On 16 September, the Council of Ministers declared a \\\\\"state of natural disaster\\\\\" for a period of 30 days in parts of the Lower Silesian, Opole, and Silesian voivodeships. As of 19 September 2024, seven people have been confirmed dead due to the flooding. The Prime Minister\\'s Office reported that the disaster has directly affected 57,000 people, with 6,544 residents evacuated as waters continue to rise. The 2024 Central European floods in Romania were triggered by Storm Boris, which brought torrential rains to the counties of Galați and Vaslui on 14 September. In less than 24 hours, over 150 mm of rainfall per square meter caused ash floods in several areas. Galați was the hardest hit, with flood waters reaching depths of 1.5 to 2 meters in the localities of Cudalbi, Cuza-Vodă, Pechea, Slobozia-Conachi, Tudor Vladimirescu, and Costache Negri. In Vaslui, the southern localities of Zorleni, Grivița, and Trestiana were most affected. The floods caused widespread destruction, severely damaging infrastructure such as roads, bridges, power systems, and schools. More than 6,000 homes were either damaged or destroyed across both counties. Around 400 people remain displaced and are currently being sheltered in temporary housing provided by authorities. Tragically, seven deaths have been confirmed.

Similarly, several townships in eastern areas of Shan State experienced flash floods and landslides between 11 and 18 August. A local community, three temporary displacement sites and a relocation site in Muse Township, which hosts around 350 displaced families have been affected. Similar incidents took place in Mogoke Township of Mandalay Region in the second week of August, with floods and landslides reportedly killing four persons, including a child, and washing away a number of houses. In Rakhine State, at least 10 villages in Toungup Township have been flooded due to heavy rains on 6 August, affecting some 1,300 houses, a hospital and paddy fields, according to local partners. Heavy rains and floods have further aggravated an already extremely challenging situation in the south-eastern parts of the country. In Kayin State, at least five townships have been affected. Another nine townships were affected by floods in Mon State, while in Tanintharyi Region, at least three townships have been affected. Local humanitarian actors, volunteers and communities responded to the needs of affected families, including with organizing temporary shelter for those who had to be evacuated to safer areas. The floods have also damaged crops, and according to initial assessments, at least 2,000 acres of paddy fields in Kyainseikgyi Township in Kayin State have been impacted, with farmers facing difficulties with seeds and expenses to cover replanting of the paddy. An additional 40,000 cultivated land has been affected across different states and regions, according to partners. The monsoon weather system is strong and active, and on 24 August, Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) forecast predicted water levels may exceed the danger level of major rivers and river dams such as Ayeyarwady River and Sittoung River that are currently in critical situation and could have the ability to impact the most at-risk areas. As of 25 August, the Thanlwin River has exceeded the danger zone. There are concerns that the weather system, fluvial floods, and flash floods could cause damage in communities across several regions, particularly in Shan (East), Kayin, Mon, Rakhine, Tanintharyi, Magway, Mandalay, Kachin, Sagaing and Chin regions. Some of these areas have experienced previous devastation by the flood in 2015 and 2017.

The vessel was carrying nearly 4,200 metric tons (MT) of fuel, including low-sulphur fuel oil (3,894 MT), diesel (207 MT) and lubricant oil (90 MT). The ship is located near ecologically sensitive and important areas, including the Point d’Esny Wetlands, Ile aux Aigrettes Nature Reserve, Blue Bay Marine Area, Mahebourg Fishing Reserves, barachois (coastal lagoons) and mangroves. The Point d’Esny Wetlands are designated as a site of international importance under the Convention on Wetlands (‘Ramsar Convention’). The Nagashiki Shipping Co. Ltd, which owns and manages the vessel, told media in an emailed statement that “due to bad weather and constant pounding over the past few days, the starboard side bunker tanker has been breached and an amount of fuel oil has escaped into the sea.” Preliminary satellite analysis conducted by UNOSAT found that the shipwreck location was approximately 2 kilometres from the shore at Point d’Esny and that 0.23km2 oil spill was observed by 6 August. Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has declared a “state of environmental emergency” and said that the sinking of the boat “represents a danger” for the people of Mauritius. The country’s approximately 1.3 million inhabitants rely heavily on tourism, which has already been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Cracks on the hull of MV Wakashio have continued to worsen and there remains a high likelihood that the bulk carrier will break-up. There are also concerns regarding the impact the oil spill will have on Mauritius’ unique ecosystems, including Blue Bay Marine Park, Pointe d’Esny Wetland and Ile aux Aigrettes Nature Reserve and wildlife. Reports indicate that the oil is likely to drift northwards, with sightings as far north as Bambous Virieux. Many people in the affected areas rely on fishing for their livelihoods, which will be impacted by the oil spill. Others rely on the tourism industry which was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and now must contend with a second significant setback.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has declared a “state of environmental emergency”.\",\\n        \"affected_countries\": [\"Mauritius\"],\\n        \"sources\": [\"OCHA\", \"UNOSAT\"],\\n        \"language\": \"English\"\\n    }\\n}',\n",

The deluge caused extensive damage, overwhelming local capacities and necessitating immediate humanitarian intervention. Just one day later, the communities of Duhu, Mayowandu, Kirchinga, Maiwandu, Jahili, Kokohu, Lumadu, Zhau, Pallam, Kwambula, Shuware, and Shuwa in Madagali Local Government Area were struck by another catastrophic flood, triggered by the upstream flow of waters from the Cameroonian highlands. This secondary flooding event exacerbated the already dire situation, compounding the devastation and further straining local resources. According to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), the floodwaters rose with alarming speed, catching residents off guard and resulting in the widespread destruction of homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods. The disaster has affected 12,583 individuals, displaced 2,079 households, and caused the destruction of 298 buildings, 203 farmlands, and 509 livestock. The immediate humanitarian needs include shelter, food, non-food items, medical assistance, and access to clean water. Heavy rainfall has been affecting northern Nigeria since 20 August, causing floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. According to International Rescue Committee (IRC), as of 2 September, at least 170 people died, 205,338 have been displaced, 515,794 have been affected, and 76,667 houses have been damaged across 28 out of 36 states, including Bauchi, Zamfara, Sokoto, Niger, and Jigawa states as the most impacted. Heavy rainfall continues to affect north-eastern Nigeria, causing floods and the Alau Dam overflowing, and resulting in casualties and damage. On 10 September, according to media, the overflow of the Alau Dam, approximately 15 km southwest of Maiduguri city, in Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria, flooded Maiduguri. Over 239,000 people have been affected and at least 50,000 people have been displaced across Fori, Galtimari, Gwange and Bulabulin areas. Several structures have been destroyed, including one hospital and one zoo. According to media, as of 12 September, the overflow of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River occurred on 10 September, and flooded Maiduguri city, in Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria. At least 30 people died, more than 414,000 have been displaced, approximately 1 million people have been affected, and thousands of houses and structures have been destroyed. More than 414,000 people are affected by floods in Borno State, with some 37 deaths and 58 people injured reported. Access to hospitals and markets and other critical infrastructure remains limited. Schools are closed with some serving as temporary relocation sites. Two major bridges in Maiduguri (Lagos Street Bridge and Gwange Bridge) have partially collapsed. Over 300,000 people have been registered in at least 26 relocation sites, as of 14 September, according to the Borno State Government’s Emergency Operations Centre. Up to 30 sites have been set up and registration is ongoing. The flood situation across Nigeria has become a major humanitarian crisis, with 31 states and 180 local government areas (LGAs) severely affected. Over 1,083,141 individuals have been impacted by the relentless rains, leading to widespread displacement, loss of lives, and destruction of homes and livelihoods. The floods have left 641,598 persons displaced, 285 people dead, and 2,504 injured. Houses, farmlands, and critical infrastructure have been devastated, with 98,242 homes affected. Between July and September 2024, 29 states across the nation experienced exceptionally high rainfall, compounded by the collapse of the Alau Dam in the Maiduguri area of Borno State, which worsened the already dire humanitarian situation, leading to widespread flooding, the collapse of bridges, closure of schools, and restricted access to hospitals and markets. The resulting devastation has caused extensive damage to homes, infrastructure, crops, and shelters, critically disrupting livelihoods and displacing thousands of households. The latest report by UNOCHA confirms that at least one million people have been affected, with 311 lives lost and more than 3,174 injured. A total of 390,000 people have been displaced, forced to flee with only the belongings they could carry, but now finding themselves in deplorable conditions, without sufficient safeguards and exposed to heightened protection risks. Roughly 245,500 people are living in collective shelters or internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, with 2,867 communities impacted across 29 states. Over 6,490,307 square metres (649.0307 hectares) of farmland have been destroyed by the floods, foreshadowing severe humanitarian consequences. Floodwaters have receded in MMC and Jere LGAs two weeks after the 9 September collapse of the Alau Dam in Borno’s Konduga LGA. As a result, and in response to ongoing efforts to reduce and consolidate temporary relocation sites, the number of people displaced by flooding has reduced from about 400,000 people housed in 36 sites at the height of the crisis to 150,000 people in 22 sites, as of 24 September. Almost four weeks after the collapse of the Alau Dam and subsequent flash floods in Borno State, flood waters have receded in the worst-hit Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) and Jere local government areas (LGAs) offering some respite to affected people. Many are returning to their homes and to host communities, while those whose homes remain submerged are being relocated to larger, more centralized temporary sites within the State. The reduction and consolidation of temporary relocation sites is ongoing to better manage the situation and to ensure the return of public facilities such as schools to their intended purpose. Several schools in Borno had been repurposed to accommodate flood-affected people. Humanitarian needs, however, remain critical despite the significant reduction in the number of displaced people living in emergency shelters, from a peak of 400,000 people at the height of flooding to about 50,000 registered individuals as of 4 October, according to the Borno State Government (BSG) Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). An additional 700,000 people also sought shelter with relatives during the flood emergency, according to authorities. Over 320 people dead, 1.3 million affected by floods in 34 states in Nigeria.

Since the Federal Ministry of Health confirmed the first two AWD cases on 9 June, the number of confirmed cases are increasing. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute reported about 2,145 (nationally) and 25 (in Addis Ababa) suspected AWD cases as of 12 June 2016. In week 15 (week ending 16 April 2017), a total of 2,388 suspected cases of AWD/cholera were reported in Afar, Amhara and Somali regions of the country. Somali region remains the most affected, accounting for 99% of the new cases reported in the reporting week. On 20 April 2017, WHO elevated the outbreak of AWD/cholera and the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia to grade 3 emergency. Since the beginning of 2017, a total of 37,459 cases including 784 deaths (case fatality rate 2.1%) have been reported from six regions of Somali, Oromia, Amhara, Afar, SNNP and Tigray. Eighty-nine percent of the reported cases and 96% of the deaths were reported in Somali Region alone. A 27 per cent increase in the number of AWD cases was reported nationwide last week, mainly due to spikes in new cases reported in Amhara and Tigray regions and a resurgence of the outbreak in Afar region where community transmission of the disease is widespread. The high risk for further spread of the AWD outbreak continues due to the degradation of health determinants on the back drop of overburdened local health systems, including inadequate access to safe drinking water and internal and cross-border movements. Between January and December 2017, a cumulative total of 48,814 cases and 880 deaths (CFR 1.8%), have been reported from 9 regions.

The flood vulnerability mapping indicates that about 59 camps could be exposed to flooding hazards, as they are located along or close to water flow accumulation areas. Paired with the continuous influx of IDPs to existing sites and to Local Government Areas, overstretching capacities on the ground, and the level of congestion in IDP sites, this will increase health and sanitation concerns.

Already, there are reports of suspected cases in Nsumbu area in Nsama District in Northern Province, and the Ministry of Health is yet to rule out epidemiological link between the two events through a risk assessment and patients record tracking. Once the risk assessment report is shared with partners, it will become clearer regarding the situation and gaps in the response strategy.

These conditions, coupled with the poor hygiene practices among citizens, has caused recurrent outbreaks of WASH related diseases.

This figure represents an increase of 206% compared with the same period in 2023 and 387% compared with the average for the last 5 years. On 16 February 2024, in view of the exponential increase in dengue cases observed in the first weeks of the year in several countries of the Region of the Americas, PAHO made an urgent appeal to Member States. The organization emphasized the need to intensify vector control measures and to maintain active surveillance, ensuring early diagnosis and timely treatment of cases. On 7 March 2024, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) of Guatemala, through the Directorate of Epidemiology and Risk Management, issued an epidemiological alert for dengue. This alert was established to reinforce dengue control and prevention plans, based on data accumulated up to epidemiological week 7, which ended on 17 February. As of that date, a total of 6,760 cases of dengue fever had been recorded this year, of which 31 were severe cases resulting in 3 deaths. The decision to issue this alert was motivated by the beginning of the high dengue transmission season in the country. As part of this measure, specific epidemiological surveillance actions were reinforced, including standardized protocols for the detection, notification, and registration of cases in hospitals and health areas. On 27 June, at a meeting of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the national level, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) verbally requested the National Society to replace the intervention in the department of Suchitepequez with that of Zacapa. This request was based on the significant increase of dengue cases in Zacapa and a considerable decrease in Suchitepequez. The request was made in response to evidence of the most affected areas and the shortage of personnel and resources needed by SPAS to address the national dengue emergency. Up to the 34th epidemiological week, 80,234 cases of dengue fever have been reported in the country. According to the same report, 14 of the 29 Departmental Directorates of Integrated Health Services Networks (DDRISS) reported an incidence of dengue that exceeds the national average.

According to Haiti’s Office for Civil Protection, 227 have died and the figure is sadly expected to increase in the coming hours. Preliminary reports by Haitian Red Cross volunteers and IFRC staff on the ground confirm that the earthquake has caused severe damage to infrastructure, including hospitals, especially in Jérémie and Les Cayes, at the Northern coast of the Southern peninsula of the country. Hospitals and hotels, as well as ports, bridges and routes are reported to have been damaged in Les Cayes and Jérémie, where churches collapsed while the morning mass was being celebrated. Search and rescue activities are concentrated in that area as there may be people trapped in the rubble. While preliminary assessments are still in their very early stages, the Haitian Civil Protection General Directorate (DGPC) reports more than 700 collapsed buildings, including hospitals, schools and churches, and 2,410 destroyed homes in the department of Nippes and 1,368 in Grand’Anse, forcing at least 470 people to seek refuge in shelters, with thousands more thought to be displaced. DGPC also reports at least 304 dead and around 1,800 more injured, figures likely to increase significantly in the coming hours and days as more are still missing. The death toll following the earthquake of 14 August has raised to 2,189 people while 332 are still missing, and more than 12,200 have been injured, as reported by the Haitian Civil Protection. At least 52,000 houses have been destroyed and more than 77,000 damaged. The powerful 7.2-magnitude earthquake which struck south-western Haiti on 14 August affected at least 800,000 people, including 340,000 children, and resulted in the death of more than 2,240 people. According to the Haitian General Directorate of Civil Protection (DGPC) and IOM, as of 20 September, an estimated 38,777 displaced people have been identified in 89 displacement locations across the three most affected departments – Grand’Anse, Nippes and Sud – with more than half of these people located in 44 locations in the Sud Department. For the more than 12,700 injured people, access to adequate healthcare remains a challenge, as the quake damaged or destroyed approximately 90 health centres, with 60 per cent of affected people stating that health services close to them have been interrupted, according to UNICEF’s U-Report survey. The rollout of the new school year has been severely hindered by the earthquake’s multifaceted impacts, with more than 900 schools – around 70 per cent of all schools in south-western Haiti – damaged or destroyed. The majority of schools have been unable to reopen their doors to students just as 300,000 children were set to gradually resume classes in the three quake-affected departments on 4 October. UNICEF estimates that if classrooms remain closed, following a one-month delay in school reopening in affected departments, more than 230,000 children are at risk of dropping out of school. The earthquake has triggered a spike in international migration from Haiti, compounding the existing migration crisis of Haitians in the Americas, with increasing numbers of Haitian nationals arriving on the shores of neighbouring countries.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"The Government and high-ranking UN officials negotiated humanitarian access for a relief convoy to pass through the main road linking the capital Port-au-Prince to the country’s southern peninsula which, up to now, had been blocked by gangs for months, with further convoys set to deliver various supplies. On 16 August, DG ECHO mobilised €3 million in emergency humanitarian funding to address the most urgent needs of the affected population. On 16 August, the Government of Haiti sent a request for international assistance to the EU Delegation in Port-au-Prince. France, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden have already offered in-kind assistance via the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. An EU Civil Protection Team was deployed to support the national authorities and coordinate the incoming EU assistance. The mission will be supported by a Technical Assistance and Support Team from the Swedish Civil Protection (MSB). More than two weeks after the devastating 14 August earthquake, humanitarian assistance is now beginning to reach those most in need faster, facilitated by enhanced Government-led coordination and robust efforts to negotiate increased humanitarian access into hard-to reach areas. The combined impact of the earthquake and Tropical Depression Grace have left 650,000 thousand people in need of emergency humanitarian assistance, of which 500,000 are being targeted by UN agencies and humanitarian partners through the activities planned under the recently launched $187.3 million Flash Appeal. From 14 August to 1 December, over 300,185 people received emergency assistance, with 4,032 mt of food and USD 2.4 million in cash-based transfers distributed. Fuel scarcity and insecurity increased starting mid-October. A truce from mid-November saw fuel distribution slowly resume throughout the country. WFP received and responded to a significant number of fuel requests from partners prioritizing medical emergencies and life-saving activities. Road access to the areas impacted by the earthquake was restricted and truck convoys from Port-au-Prince to the south were suspended as of mid-October. WFP continued its barge service from Port-au-Prince to the commune of Carrefour in the suburban area of the capital to transport humanitarian assistance to the south. Since the earthquake, over 130 voyages have been organised. Despite these delays and challenges, distributions by WFP and partners continued. Access to basic healthcare, nutrition, and safe water, sanitation, and hygiene services remains critical with important needs after the devastating earthquake that hit southwestern Haiti on 14 August. According to the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), total damages and loss are estimated at US$ 1.62 billion, while recovery needs at US$ 1.98 billion. Relief efforts have been severely hampered by a shortage of fuel throughout the country, while the humanitarian corridor has been interrupted due to increased gangs’ violence and insecurity. UNICEF water trucking facilitated access to water for drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene for approximately 419,000 persons (69,000 in the reporting period).

As of 24 July, 31 fatalities, 41 persons still missing and 74 injured people are reported across Jalrez, Saydabad, Chaki Wardak and Maidan Shahr Districts, Maidan Wardak Province. Around 600 houses were reported damaged or destroyed across the same Province. In addition, media also reports four fatalities in the Kabul Capital City area and one more in the Khost Province, also in these cases due to flash floods. As of 30 July 2023, according to reports from various sources including the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) and the Afghan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), flash floods have led to the loss of 61 lives, left 24 people injured and six people missing. The province of Maidan Wardak is the most impacted and accounts for 37 of the 61 human lives lost. Based on the preliminary findings of the initial rapid assessment carried out by the ARCS, approximately 126,000 people have been affected by the disaster in 18 provinces. The flash floods have also partially or completely damaged 1,360 residential houses and washed away over 13,023 hectares of agricultural land and killed at least 1,128 livestock. Some of the provinces such as Badakhshan, Maidain Wardak and Nangahar have experienced such floods for the first time while others have experienced more severe floods this year than the ones in the past. The country is particularly vulnerable to variations in access to arable land and water due to drought that have been affecting the country for the last three consecutive years. New areas are experiencing floods due to dryness of land caused by drought for three consecutive years. Between 1 and 30 July, heavy rains intensified and flash flooding affected some 6,193 people across eight provinces of Afghanistan – 1,071 people in Kabul; 1,345 people in Kunar; 130 people in Laghman, 1,617 people in Maidan Wardak; 755 people in Nangarhar, 574 people in Nuristan; 581 people in Parwan; and 120 people in Zabul. Some 40 people were reportedly killed and 30 others were injured, while some 551 houses were damaged, and 121 others were destroyed. OCHA and humanitarian partners are conducting assessments alongside providing lifesaving assistance to the affected families. The number of people affected is anticipated to increase based on forecasts of more heavy rains and flooding in August, according to the Afghanistan meteorological department. Of all the natural disasters that have occurred in Afghanistan this year, flash flooding and heavy rains caused the most havoc as of the end of August, followed by earthquakes and heavy snowfall during the 2022/2023 winter. In total, around 21,500 people (2,952 families) affected by flooding, with 51 people killed, a further 62 injured, and 553 houses destroyed, and significant damage caused to 1,950 homes in 23 provinces across the country. Floods and heavy rains have also reportedly destroyed more than 3,000 acres of agricultural land, 50 irrigation canals, and 20 Kms of road, forests and farm infrastructure. The damage was most extensive in the north-eastern, central, and southern regions where 8,640, 5,830, and 1,193 people respectively were affected.

As water levels rise in rivers, there are reports of riverine flooding in Jubaland. FAO’s Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) reported heavy rains in Somaliland where on 26 April, Lughaye and surrounding areas received unusually heavy rains of 102mm. On 23 April, heavy rains were also received within the Juba river basin. SWALIM forecasts increased rainfall activity in most areas in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands in the coming week, which is likely to keep the water levels high in the Shabelle and Juba rivers. The flooding has started barely four months after heavy Deyr (October-December) rains inundated parts of Somalia, affecting over half a million people; and as the country works to contain the COVID-19 virus, which is exponentially rising and has already infected several hundreds of people. The country is also working to contain a desert locust infestation. Since 20 April, heavy rain has been affecting most of Somalia States and territories (particularly South West, Jubaland, Banadir, Puntland, and Somaliland) as well as the neighbouring central and south Ethiopia since 24 April, causing rivers to overflow and triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The worst affected area is the Juba river basin and the Shabelle river basin. In Somalia, as of 29 April, media report 10 fatalities, a number of missing people, around 20 injured people, hundreds more displaced, as well as damage to infrastructure in Qardho Town (Bari Region, west Puntland). The number of people affected by flooding in Somalia has risen to 546,103, of whom 216,895 people have been displaced from their homes and 16 others killed since the Gu’ rains started in early April. At least 27 districts are inundated; the worst being Belet Weyne in Hiran region where riverine flooding has displaced more than 115,000 people, according to the district flood taskforce. This includes about 91,000 people who have been displaced from the four sections of the town and 23,220 people from 23 riverine villages. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy rains in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands. According to the taskforce, more people were fleeing their homes as river levels rise. As of 10 May, the river levels reached 7.93 meters which is 0.37 meter below the bank full level of 8.30 meters. Ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 918,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts, as of 16 May. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to crowding in areas where displaced people are seeking temporary shelter. As of 19 May, ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 919,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts. Belet Weyne in Hiraan region is the most affected district after the Shabelle river burst its banks on 12 May, inundating 85 per cent of Belet Weyne town and 25 riverine villages. According to the district flood taskforce, about 240,000 people were displaced from the town and neighbouring villages between 12 and 18 May. In Jowhar district, Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected more than 98,000 people in 37 locations, bringing the total affected in Hirshabelle to 338,000 people. According to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in Hirshabelle State, nearly 40 per cent of those affected in Jowhar have been displaced from their homes. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to overcrowding in areas where the displaced people are seeking temporary. Flash and riverine floods have since late June affected an estimated 191,800 people in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region. Among those affected, about 124,200 people have been displaced from their homes. Another 5,000 people are at risk of further displacement in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle. Since May, an estimated 149,000 hectares of farmland have been damaged by floods in 100 villages in Jowhar, Mahaday and Balcad districts, Middle Shabelle region. The latest floods point to a worrying pattern where extreme weather conditions are increasing in frequency and intensity. Prior to June 2020, flash floods and riverine flooding caused by seasonal rains displaced more than 450,000 in the country. With floods in 2018 and 2019 displacing 281,000 and 416,000 persons respectively, the flood-based displacement figures demonstrate a rising year-to-year trend. Somalia’s re-occurring climate related emergencies result in devastating impact on communities who heavily rely on farming and livestock for their livelihood. Riverine flooding continues to displace people and inundate farmland in rural areas mainly along the Shabelle river valley. The floods, which are attributed to the Hagaa seasonal rains, have affected nearly 500,000 people since late June in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland States, as well as Banadir region.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"OCHA and other humanitarian organizations have been actively involved in providing relief to the affected populations.

On 30 October at 0.00 UTC, its centre was approximately 275 km east-southeast of Quy Nhon City (Binh Dinh Province, central Vietnam) with maximum sustained winds of 65 km/h (tropical storm). Tropical depression MATMO was moving into Cambodia from Vietnam on 31 October and is expected to bring heavy rain to the central part of Thailand, where temperatures are also dropping over next few days. Strong winds and heavy rains have resulted in power loss and damaged buildings and houses in the southern central provinces of Binh Din and Phú Yên, Vietnam. The authorities evacuated around 15,000 households to safer places. A considerable rise of the water level of Rivers in Phú Yên, including Cai River have been observed representing a high flooding risk. In Quang Ngãi Province, many houses were damaged and trees were uprooted, particularly in local southern districts. The Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control of Vietnam reported, that Typhoon Matmo has destroyed 179 houses, damaged 2,314 buildings and 35 schools in the provinces of Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Gia Lai and Thua Thien Hue. As of 4 November, 1 person is reported missing, 14 people have been injured and 20,000 displaced. After passing over south-east Asia, Tropical Cyclone MATMO has reformed over the Bay of Bengal. On 7 November its centre was approximately 480 km south-west of Ayeyarwady Region with maximum sustained winds of 93 km/h. On 7-8 November, rain and thunderstorms are forecast over eastern Myanmar, Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India) and strong winds in West Bengal. Preparedness planning is ongoing in the Cox’s Bazar district in Bangladesh, which hosts close to a million refugees. The severe cyclonic storm ‘Bulbul’ has intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm as it moves towards the West Bengal and Bangladesh coast. The system is likely to intensify further before turning north-east across the West Bengal - Bangladesh coast between Sagar Islands and Khepupara, across Sundarbans delta on 10 November with maximum sustained wind speed of 110-120 km/h to 135 km/h. Heavy to very heavy rain and strong winds are forecast over West Bengal and Odisha coasts in India, and Khulna and Barisal divisions in Bangladesh over the next 4 days. As of 10 November, the system has weakened to a Cyclonic Storm with a maximum sustained wind speed of 80-90 km/h and centred over Southwestern part of Bangladesh. It is expected to further move northeasterly direction and weaken gradually. The number of fatalities in West Bengal State (India) and southern Bangladesh has increased to 20, after Tropical Cyclone BULBUL\\'s passage on 9-10 November. According to media reports, 10 people died in West Bengal, and 2 more deaths were reported in Odisha State (north-east India). Over 26,000 houses were damaged. In Bangladesh, 8 people died, 15 fishermen are still missing, and at least 30 people are injured. More than 17,000 houses have been damaged and river embankments were breached in Barguna district (Barisal Division, southern Bangladesh).

Between weeks 1 and 9 of 2018, there have been 210 suspected cases including two laboratory-confirmed and 16 deaths (CFR 7.6%) from 28 LGAs in 9 States. North-east Nigeria is experiencing recurrent cholera outbreaks, with three states: Adamawa, Borno and Yobe currently having active transmission. Since February 2018, the three states in north-east Nigeria have reported a total of 1,664 suspected cholera cases and 31 deaths (case fatality rate 1.9%), as of 27 May 2018. With more than 14 days since the last reported case of cholera, Yobe State Ministry of Health has declared that the outbreak is over on 12 June 2018. The outbreak of cholera in Nigeria has remained persistent since the beginning of 2018. In epi-week 28 (week ending 15 July 2018), 367 new suspected cases with four deaths (case fatality ratio 1.1%) were reported from six states – Adamawa (42), Bauchi (56), Katsina (68), Niger (14), Plateau (11), and Zamfara (176).

With no new cases reported in the last four weeks in Anambra, Nasarawa, Borno, and Yobe States the outbreak is considered to be under control in these states. The decrease in the number of cases has also been reported from Adamawa State, which has been one of the epi-centres of this outbreak. This is contributing to the overall declining trend across the country except in Zamfara and Katsina States where the number of cases reported is still high. A total of 889 cases of suspected cholera have been recorded in eight local government areas (LGAs), including 19 deaths, as of 10 September 2018. This represents a fatality rate of 2.1 per cent. The number of cases has increased by 30 percent between 7 September and 10 September 2018, including one additional death. Jere, Magumeri and Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) have seen the largest spike in case numbers, largely due to the poor water, sanitation and hygiene conditions in these areas that are also congested. As of 26 September 2018, a total of 3,703 cases with 68 deaths (CFR 1.8%) have been reported from twelve health districts in four regions of the country, namely, Maradi, Dosso, Zender, and Tahoua regions. Madarounfa District in Maradi Region remains the most affected with 90% of the cumulative cases reported. The majority of cases are age 5 and above and females constitute 56.2% of the cases reported. A total of 34 samples have tested positive by culture for Vibrio cholerae 01 inaba. Fourteen percent of the cumulative cases reported are residents from Nigeria. In week 43 (week ending 28 October 2018), 173 new suspected cases with one death were reported from five states: Adamawa (92 cases with one death), Zamfara (37 cases), Borno (35 cases), Yobe (6 cases), and Katsina (4 cases). There is an overall downward trend in the number of cases across the country. The total number of suspected cholera cases in Borno reported between 26th November and 2nd December 2018 stands at 6,307 with 73 associated deaths. The total number of suspected cholera cases reported in Yobe state is 1,812 with 61 associated deaths (CFR 3.37%). In the state, up to 591 cases have been reported in Gulani LGA, 485 cases in Gujba LGA and 488 cases in Damaturu LGA. In Fune LGA, 181 cases were reported and 67 cases were reported in Potiskum LGA. Borno and Yobe States officially declared the end of cholera outbreaks on 15 January 2019 following zero new cases for more than two consecutive weeks. Across the country, a declining trend was noted since early November with zero cases reported in the last three weeks. In 2018, twenty states reported outbreaks of cholera across Nigeria with Bauchi, Zamfara, Borno, and Katsina states accounting for 74% of the cumulative cases. Suspicious cases remain concentrated in the states of Bayelsa (41) and Kano (6). Since the beginning of the year, 579 suspected cases have been reported, including 24 recorded deaths. On 18 June 2019, the State Ministry of Health of Adamawa State in north-east Nigeria officially declared a cholera outbreak in three local government areas (LGAs). The cholera outbreak started on 15 May 2019 (week 19) in Yola North LGA and spread to Girei LGA in week 22 and eventually to Yola South LGA in week 23 (week ending 9 June 2019). In week 24 (week ending 16 June 2019), 37 new suspected cholera cases were reported, with no deaths. From 15 May to 28 June 2019, a cumulative total of 156 cases with one death (CFR 0.6%) have been reported from three LGAs with the caseload distributed as follows: Yola North (74 cases with one death), Girei (79 cases with zero deaths), and Yola South (three cases with zero deaths). The number of cases of cholera reported in Adamawa State has been on a declining trend. On 25 September 2019, one new case was reported from Girei Local Government Area. From 15 May to 25 September 2019, a cumulative total of 774 cases with four deaths have been reported from four LGAs: Yola North (471 cases with two deaths), Girei (192 cases with one death), Yola South (110 cases with one death), and Song (1 case with zero deaths). Three new cases of cholera were reported in Adamawa State from 27 November to 6 December 2019 from Yola North (2) and Yola South (1) Local Government Areas. From 15 May to 6 December 2019, a cumulative total of 839 suspected cases with four deaths have been reported from four LGAs: Yola North (513 cases with two deaths), Girei (200 cases with one death), Yola South (125 cases with one death), and Song (1 case with zero deaths). Of 539 stool specimens collected and analysed at the state specialist hospital, 206 cultured Vibrio cholerae as the causative agent. An outbreak of cholera has also been reported in Andoni Local Government Area, Rivers State. From 27 November to 9 December 2019, a total of 56 cases with 11 deaths were reported from 15 communities in Andoni LGA. As at March 28th, 2021, a total of 1,746 suspected cases including 50 deaths (CFR = 2.9%) have been reported from eight states (Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto and Nasarawa) since the beginning of 2021. Very active inter-community transmission in Nigeria, specifically in Bauchi, and Kano states, which have recorded 2,535 cases and 18 deaths (CFR 0.7%), and 572 cases including 19 (CFR 3.3%) deaths respectively in the last two weeks. In total Nigeria has 18 states in epidemic out of 36 states in the country, with 3,650 cases and 47 total deaths in the last two weeks. A total of 27.8% of the cases since the beginning of the year are children aged 5 to 14. Nigeria is experiencing one of its worst cholera outbreaks in years. According to Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Cholera Situation Report No. 38, as of 21st September 2021, a total of 73,055 suspected cases including 2,407 deaths (CFR 3.3%) have been reported from 27 states out of 36 states and in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). With over 2,407 people dead from suspected cholera this year, there are concerns that there might be an undercount given that many affected communities are in hard-to-reach areas with high security challenges. Indeed, although the overall situation across the country seemed to be improving with significant reduction of cases as of week 32, it has also been highlighted those cases are being reported in additional states and cases increasing again as of week 38 in areas where it had dropped.

A tsunami warning was issued but has since been lifted. Search and rescue operations are ongoing at the time of reporting. Preliminary reports indicate observed damages to buildings and infrastructure in Port Vila, with six unconfirmed casualties and injuries reported. According to UNOSAT initial exposure analysis, an estimate of 116,000 people could be affected by the worst impacts of the earthquake. Telecommunications remain disrupted and is affecting the timeliness of field reports from remote areas. Access to the airport and water port is severely limited due to road damage. Key immediate needs include healthcare support, shelter, access to clean water, and the restoration of emergency communications. As of 18th December, NDMO confirmed 14 fatalities either from collapsed buildings or landslides. The numbers may rise as search and rescue operations intensifies and expands. Over 200 are reported injured while many are still missing. According to UNICEF staff on the ground, most injuries are fractures, cuts and traumas related to falling objects and sharp items. According to NDMO, two major water reservoirs in Port Vila are severely damaged. Assessment of water network is ongoing with affected residents already rationing water. Approximately 80,000 people have been directly affected by the earthquake, of which 14,104 are children and 769 are persons with disabilities (PWD). The Disaster Evacuation Centre Management Cluster (DEMC) reports that 947 people have been displaced. Infrastructure damage is extensive, with landslides further obstructing road access in Efate and outer islands, including routes to the Seaport. The airport is currently closed to all commercial flights. Physical Access challenges continue to hamper response efforts. The situation in Vanuatu remains critical following the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck on December 17, 2024. VMGD has confirmed that approximately 300 aftershocks, ranging from magnitudes of 2.0 to 5.3, have occurred with shallow depths between December 17 and December 19. The earthquake has resulted in significant devastation, with the death toll rising to 14 (eight males, five females, one unknown) and 265 injuries. Two major water reservoirs in Port Vila sustained severe damage, and ongoing assessments of the water network have led to water rationing for residents. Port Vila International Airport resumed commercial flights on 22 December, following consultations with airport agencies. However, landslides and damaged roads and bridges have hindered access to the airport and seaport. While the airport is operational, the seaport is still closed. The situation is compounded by the ongoing cyclone season, with three tropical cyclones predicted in the region posing more risks to already vulnerable populations. State of Emergency (SOE) concluded on December 24, 2024 with the coordination of operations transitioning to the Recovery Operations Centre (ROC) under the Prime Minister\\'s Office. The NDMO, National Cluster Partners and Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) members are coordinating ongoing distribution of relief items to meet needs identified under the SOE including shelter, WASH, Protection, Health, Food and other essential supplies. Power, Water and phone service has been largely restored though internet services are still under repair. The situation in Vanuatu remains critical following the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck on December 17, 2024. Ongoing aftershocks pose a high risk of landslides and building collapses. The earthquake has resulted in at least 14 fatalities and more than 265 injuries. 1,092 people remain temporarily displaced, 570 houses have been damaged affecting 2,850 people. Infrastructure damage is extensive, with landslides obstructing road access to Efate and the outer islands, including the main seaport. In the education sector, 110 classrooms across 45 schools have been partially or completely damaged. Now that the State of Emergency has ended, the government has established a Recovery Operation Centre (ROC). In early January, the Director of the Department of Strategic Policy, Planning, and Aid Coordination (DSPPAC) and the Chairman of the ROC estimated that around CHF 217 million (VUV 29 billion) was needed to fund the recovery. As of 21 January, VRCS has reached an estimated total of 9,072 people with the support of its partners, including the IFRC. As of 17 January 2025, the Vanuatu Displacement and Evacuation Centre Management (DECM) cluster reported 315 people remained formally displaced. Of these, 39 were staying in two evacuation centres, while the remaining 364 were staying with 25 host households. It is likely that there are others who are displaced and staying with family and friends. On 7 January 2025, the Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) reported that 570 houses had been identified as damaged. The PHT also reported that the 13 health facilities in affected areas were functional, although some required minor repairs. The Ministry of Education and Training has assessed over 200 schools and identified that 45 schools were partially or completely damaged as a result of the earthquake. It is estimated it will cost over US$8 million (over CHF 7.2 million) to rebuild damaged schools. As of 7 February 2025, the Vanuatu Displacement and Evacuation Centre Management (DECM) cluster reported 124 people remained formally displaced.

Government officials raised the Volcanic Alert Level from 2 to 3 on 18 March 2018. Ambae volcano is a very large volcano and is frequently active. Eruptions have been recorded every 10 to 50 years over the past 150 years. The current eruption is focused in the summit crater. As of 16 April, the volcano once again spewed out ash and harmful smoke. Vanuatu\\'s government is now looking into acquiring land to permanently resettle the island\\'s 13,000 residents. The Council of Ministers has declared a State of Emergency on Ambae Island. Approximately 750 people have lost their homes, 643 as a result of the volcanic ash, and 115 by landslides. The Council of Ministers has ordered the entire population to evacuate the island. As of 27 April, there has been resistance to the mandatory evacuation plan over a 2-week period between 1 to 15 May. The Penama provincial government declared that they will purchase land on the West and East of Ambae to accommodate people who need to evacuate from the worst affected areas. The proportion of the population who will require on-/off-island assistance remains unclear, and it is anticipated that evacuated populations will require emergency shelter assistance and household items. As of 15 May, the volcanic activity has decreased with reduced ashfall experienced during the first two weeks of May. The ash has, however, increased the risk of landslides, two of which were triggered by heavy rain and destroyed all houses in two communities. Residents in the most ash-affected communities have been evacuated to designated safe zones. Some 112 families (469 persons) from southern Ambae have sought refuge in 10 host communities in the east, whilst 757 families (3,055 persons) from the northern communities are temporarily sheltering in Saint Patrick’s College and Torgil Training Center in the northeast. An undetermined number have voluntarily relocated to Santo, Efate and other nearby islands. A state of emergency was in effect on the island of Ambae until 13 July as the activity of the Manaro Voui volcano remained unpredictable. On 7 June, the threat level of the Manaro Voui volcano is categorized as “major unrest state”, and was lowered from volcanic alert level three to level two; with the danger zone now limited to a 2 km radius from the active vent. Parts of Ambae Island have been blanketed with ash for weeks, and although volcanic activity has recently decreased, light ashfall continues to be experienced in some northern parts of the island. In previous weeks, the ashfall had increased the risk of landslides, two of which were triggered by heavy rain and destroyed all houses in two affected communities. Residents in the most ash-affected communities left their homes and evacuated to designated safe zones. Some 2,000 residents remain displaced on Ambae living with host communities or in evacuation centres on the island, whilst around 800 people are known to have voluntarily left Ambae relocating to Santo, Efate and other nearby islands. As of 10 July, the Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 2 due to its continued and major unrest state. Observations have confirmed that the volcanic activity has been unstable since 20 June. On 1 July, the volcano emitted a column of ash which induced heavy to light ash fall driven by the prevailing trade wind at villages from North-West to West of Ambae Island and the North-Eastern part of Santo Island. A small eruption scale in Lake Voui is continuing. On 16 July, much of the east and north of Vanuatu\\'s Ambae Island experienced heavy ashfall after the eruption from the volcano intensified, residents said. A second state of emergency was declared by the Government of Vanuatu’s Council of Ministers (COM) from 26 July to 26 September 2018. In addition, an order was made to immediately evacuate all people in Ambae to nearby Maewo island. As of 23 August, Ambae volcano remains in the minor eruption state at Volcanic Alert Level 3. The volcanic activity is likely to remain at the minor eruptive activity or decrease to a major level of unrest at any time. The Danger Zone for life safety is limited at 3 km radius from the active vent and areas located in the Yellow Zone. As of 21 September, Ambae volcano is in the major unrest state. The Volcanic Alert Level is lowered to Level 2. The Danger Zone for life safety is now limited at 2 km radius from the active vent and areas located in the Yellow Zone. Observations in September 2018 confirm that the eruptive activity occurred in July until August has dropped. There is no explosions and volcanic cloud emitted are white colour, means only steam.

Koshi, Karnali, and Narayani are the major river systems in Nepal, and floods from these large perennial river systems generally impact several districts in the Southern Terai plains. Moreover, rivers such as West Rapti, and Babai Rivers, which originate in the Mahabharat range, do more damage in the Terai floodplains because they frequently generate flash floods during the monsoon. Moreover, the Terai\\'s vulnerable topography, combined with its dependency on agriculture, exacerbates the severity of flood hazards compared to other regions. The targeted flood-prone areas are the Terai districts along the flood plains of Karnali, Babai and West Rapti rivers, namely Banke, Bardiya and Kailali, frequently affected due to flooding in the monsoon period. People living along these rivers especially low-lying areas, informal settlements, fragile houses, and those who have low-income status and a number of dependent family members to care for, are highly vulnerable to flooding; especially during the monsoon (June to September). The monsoon season is impacting several parts of Nepal, causing floods, triggering landslides and resulting in casualties and damage. According to the Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal, as of 8 July, 21 people have died since the beginning of the month - 12 due to landslides and nine others to floods - three people are still missing, 29 have been injured and 541 families have been affected across several districts of the country. Heavy rainfall has been affecting central Nepal (particularly the Gandaki province and the neighbouring Bagmati province over the last 24 hours, triggering huge landslides that have resulted in casualties and damage. Media report, as of 12 July, 11 fatalities across the Kaski district (Gandaki province), one fatality and 65 persons still missing in the Chitwan district (Bagmati province) due to different landslide events. Over the next 96 hours, very heavy rainfall is still forecast over most of Nepal. In the past few days, a series of landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rainfall have occurred in parts of Nepal and resulted in casualties and damage. In particular, in Chitwan District, south-central Nepal, a major landslide swept away two passenger buses, leading to eight fatalities and 54 still missing people as reported by the Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal (DRR) and media. According to the DRR portal, since 10 July, a total of 25 people died and 13 others have been injured in five different landslide events across the districts of Baglung, Chitawan, Kaski, and Myagdi. With the onset of monsoon rainfall in various parts of Nepal, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs, 143 people died and 47 people went missing as of data dated 30th July 2024 due to disasters such as floods and landslides in various places. 22 people died in Koshi province, 6 people died in Madhesh province, 31 people died in Bagmati province due to floods and landslides. According to the ministry, 42 people died in Gandaki province, 24 people in Lumbini, 8 people in Karnali and 10 people in Sudurpaschim province. During the period, more than 3,779 households were displaced from their homes by the disaster. A glacial lake outburst occurred in the Koshi province (the easternmost province of Nepal) on 16 August, causing flash floods and mudslides that resulted in displacement and damage.

As of 17 November, communities along the River Nile are worst affected and account for 91 per cent of reported cholera cases. A total of 2,874 cases and all 44 deaths from the outbreak have been reported from eight counties straddling the River Nile: Awerial, Duk, Fangak, Juba, Leer, Pageri, Pigi and Terekeka. Rubkona is the only county affected by the outbreak that is not along the Nile. Juba has the highest number of cases (1,990 - 63 per cent of the total), while Terekeka has the highest case fatality rate. As of 5 May 2017, cholera outbreaks have been confirmed in 19 counties in South Sudan. The most affected counties are located along the River Nile. This suggests vehicle-borne transmission from contaminated water in affected counties. Cumulatively, 7,735 cholera cases, including 246 deaths (76 facilities and 170 community) (CFR 3.23%), have been reported in South Sudan since the initial case was reported on 18 June 2016. Nine out of 19 counties ever affected since June 2016 are considered to have active transmission, having reported cholera cases in the past four weeks. Cholera transmission has continued to decline countrywide. In the last four weeks [weeks 37-40], cholera cases dropped from at least 40 cases in week 37 of 2017 to at least 15 cases in week 40 of 2017. Three counties [Juba, Budi, and Fangak] have registered cholera transmission in the last four weeks [37-40]. A total of 135 cases have been reported from the three counties in the last four weeks [37-40]. Most of the cases have been reported from Juba [112 cases] while Budi and Fangak reported 16 cases and 7 cases respectively. As part of the ongoing cholera response, health partners have deployed cholera vaccines to complement traditional prevention strategies in several high-risk populations and locations. This is the latest step in ongoing efforts to end South Sudan’s longest and deadliest cholera outbreak.

The suspected cases reported increased from 136 cases in Week 1 of 2023 to 253 cases by Week 4. As of 2nd March 2023, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recorded again further increase of the disease. In the total of 733 suspected cases, including 89 deaths, children between the ages of 5 and 18 are the age group most afflicted. The overall case fatality rate is (12.3%). The latest data received by the World Health Organization (WHO) from ProMed reported that 20 states are currently reporting suspected cases. This outbreak has been labelled as one of the most severe outbreaks of diphtheria in Nigeria in recent years. Since the beginning of 2023, 557 confirmed cases of diphtheria have been detected in Nigeria, affecting 21 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) is aware of the death in June 2023 of a four-year-old with diphtheria in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. The NCDC, since December 2022, has reported multiple diphtheria outbreaks in different states across the country. As of June 30th, 2023, there have been 798 confirmed diphtheria cases from 33 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in eight (8) States including the FCT. Most of the cases (782) were recorded in Kano. Other States with cases are Lagos, Yobe, Katsina, Cross River, Kaduna, and Osun. The majority (71.7%) of the 798 confirmed cases occurred among children aged 2 – 14 years. So far, a total of 80 deaths have been recorded among all confirmed cases (case fatality rate of 10.0%). UNICEF Nigeria is amplifying its efforts to counter a growing outbreak of diphtheria that has affected children in 27 states. As of July 2023, 3,850 suspected cases were reported with 1,387 confirmed as diphtheria. The disease has tragically claimed 122 lives, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 8.7%. The outbreak has affected mainly Kano, Yobe, Katsina, Lagos, FCT, Sokoto, and Zamfara, which account for 98.0% of the suspected cases. Most confirmed cases, approximately 71.5%, have occurred among children aged 2–14 years. Between week 19, 2022 and week 31, 2023, 4 160 suspected cases of diphtheria were reported from 27 states in Nigeria. Kano (3 233), Yobe (477), and Katsina (132) States have reported the most cases. A total of 137 deaths were recorded among confirmed cases (CFR 7.5%). Of suspected cases, 1 534 were confirmed, including 87 laboratory confirmed, 158 epidemiologically linked, and 1 289 clinically compatible. With low national vaccination coverage and a worldwide shortage of lifesaving antitoxin threatening to worsen the outbreak, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) urges the international community to immediately scale up support to improve treatment, preventive measures and contact tracing to control the outbreak’s spread. “We’re currently seeing more than 700 people with suspected diphtheria and admitting more than 280 patients on a weekly basis in Kano state’s two diphtheria treatment centres,” says Dr Hashim Juma Omar, MSF emergency project medical doctor. “Women and children aged under five are the most vulnerable groups and are the people most affected right now in Kano state. And they really need help.” The outbreak has reached alarming proportions, with 32 states affected, and 12 states experiencing severe cases. Kano State reports the highest number of new infections, with Yobe state also facing a serious situation, resulting in the tragic loss of 117 children, according to the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency. Between week 19 of 2022 and week 6 of 2024, a total of 27 078 suspected cases of diphtheria were reported from 36 states in Nigeria. Among these cases, 16 603 were confirmed, comprising 365 laboratory-confirmed, 483 epidemiologically linked, and 15 755 clinically compatible cases. From week 1 to week 8 of 2024, 417 suspected diphtheria cases and 16 deaths (CFR 3.8%) were reported in the BAY States in 23/65 LGA (Adamawa 2 cases, 0 deaths; Borno 271 cases, 14 deaths; Yobe 144 cases, 2 deaths).

The cyclone is currently located in the central Bay of Bengal and will track north, north-eastward towards India and Bangladesh. The system is very likely to intensify further into a major tropical cyclone in the next 24 hours. According to the latest forecasts, the cyclone will make a landfall on 20 May somewhere in NE India, West Bengal – Bangladesh coast. It is expected that it will bring strong winds, very rough sea conditions, storm surge and heavy rain across Odisha and west Bengal coasts. The Indian Meteorological Department has issued an orange alert for this region. A red alert has been issued for Gangetic West Bengal, which urges residents to take action to protect themselves from extremely heavy rainfall and severe winds. Bangladesh Meteorological Department has issued a Special Weather Bulletin and a warning alert as well. The Government of Odisha has identified 567 cyclone shelters, as well as 7,000 community buildings to relocate around 1.1 million people across 649 villages along the seacoast. The community based COVID-19 quarantine centres in coastal areas are being shifted to safe locations. The State and the National Disaster Management forces are in readiness. The Communities Working Group in Cox’s Bazar works on community level awareness in all 34 camps. As of 22 May, a satellite detected inundated areas around Kolkata, West Bengal, India. An International Water Management Institute map shows the inundation extent covering the city of Kolkata after the Super cyclone landfall on 20 May at 5:00 PM.

Thailand: A warning is in effect for high waves, flash floods and landslides in 14 southern provinces from 18-20 May as a result of Tropical Cyclone Amphan. Tropical storms have already damaged 1,305 homes in 11 upper provinces in northern, northeastern, central and eastern regions of the country. As of 19 May, tropical Cyclone AMPHAN has intensified into a super cyclonic storm as it continues north over the central Bay of Bengal, toward India\\'s Odisha and West Bengal States and Bangladesh\\'s Barisal Division. AMPHAN is expected to continue towards the Odisha coast, slightly weakening before making landfall over southern West Bengal on the morning of 20 May with maximum sustained winds of 190-210 km/h. The Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) in Bangladesh estimates that up to 14.2 million people in coastal districts are likely to be affected, with nearly 1.4 million displaced and up to 600,000 houses damaged. Evacuation from high-risk areas is to begin today and is already underway in high-risk areas in India. Tropical Cyclone AMPHAN continues towards India\\'s Odisha and West Benagal States and southern Bangladesh\\'s Barisal Division. On 20 May at 0.00 UTC its centre was 195 km south-east of Bhubaneshwar City (Odisha), and 370 km south-southwest of Kolkata (West Bengal), with maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h. According to media reports, national authorities in India are evacuating 1.1 to 1.2 million people from Odisha and from West Bengal, 2 million in Bangladesh. AMPHAN should make landfall over southern West Bangal (approximately 50 km south of Haldia and 100 km south of Kolkata) on 20 May, with maximum sustained winds up to 160 km/h before weakening as it moves over eastern West Bengal and western and central Bangladesh on 20-21 May. A red alert for heavy rain and thunderstorms is in effect over West Bengal (India) and a storm surge and wind warnings over coastal districts of Bangladesh over the next 24 hours. As of 21 of May, cyclone Amphan has made a landfall and it is crossing the West Bengal- Bangladesh Coast east of Sagar Island. According to the latest special weather bulletin of the Met Department of Bangladesh issued around 7.30 p.m., the cyclone currently lies over the coastal West Bengal and Sundarban on the Bangladeshi coast after making a landfall around 4 p.m. in West Bengal. It is likely to move in a north-northeasterly direction further and complete crossing the coast within the next 3-4 hours. Maximum wind speed within 74 kilometres of the Cyclone centre is about 160 kilometre per hour (kmph) rising to 180 kmph in gusts/ squalls. TC AMPHAN made landfall between Digha (West Bengal) and Hatiya Islands (Bangladesh) on Wednesday 20 May as category 3 storm (Saffir-Simpson scale) bringing strong winds up to 185 km/h and heavy rain, damaging houses, crops and cutting power supplies to cities and towns already struggling to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. At least 14 people have been reported killed in India and 7 in Bangladesh. More than three million people have been evacuated to emergency shelters. After landfall TC AMPHAN was downgraded to a tropical depression, but is expected to bring heavy to moderate rain over the next 24 hours in the northeast Indian states, West Bengal and Sikkim, as well as in most of Bangladesh, including in the Rohingya refugees camps. According to UNICEF\\'s reporting, the storm has put many people at risk, not only as a direct effect of floods and wind damage, but also given the potential spread of COVID-19 in crowded evacuation shelters. At least 77 deaths in India and 25 in Bangladesh have been reported so far. Over three million people in both countries continue to remain in community shelters. Significant damage has been reported in thatched houses, standing crops, horticulture, fisheries, power and telecommunication facilities in cyclone-affected areas. Most areas remained without electricity and communication network and blocked roads limiting a rapid response. In Cox\\'s Bazar, flooding and small landslides have caused damage to 300 shelters, blocked drains and damaged stairs, latrines and bridges. In India, Odisha and West Bengal states were affected, with nearly 60 million people affected and at least 80 people killed in West Bengal alone. More than 700,000 people were evacuated across India and at least 80,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. In Bangladesh, 10 million people were affected by Cyclone Amphan and at least 25 people were killed. An estimated 2.4 million people were evacuated ahead of the storm. According to preliminary reports, 330,000 houses were damaged, including 55,600 destroyed in the nine most affected districts. The cyclone led to the internal displacement of at least 100,000 people who are currently staying on embankments and with friends or relatives. Satkhira, Khulna, Barguna, and Patuakhali districts were most severely affected, with up to 1.2 million people highly affected in those four districts alone. In Bangladesh, tropical cyclone Amphan has severely affected the livelihoods of at least 1 million people, destroyed houses and infrastructure, including irrigation facilities. According to initial Government estimates, the overall damage to housing, infrastructure, fisheries, livestock and crops was set at BDT 11 billion (USD 130 million). The most affected areas are located in the southwestern parts of the country, including the districts of Khulna, Jessore, Satkhira, Bagerha and Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhota and Noakhali. Although the path of the cyclone did not hit Cox’s Bazar, the effects of the cyclone nevertheless was felt in the refugee settlements in Cox’s Bazar, which received heavy rain and strong winds. The Bangladesh Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) raised three flags as an alert sign for refugees in the Cox’s Bazar refugee settlements. The three flag was the highest alert level that refugees have seen for a cyclone since many of them first arrived in Bangladesh in 2017. Over 1,252 shelters were partially damaged and 159 shelters completely destroyed, temporarily displacing 144 households. In total, close to 6,000 refugees were affected by the cyclone. According to the rapid assessment report conducted in June 2020 by Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), in West Bengal, India, 2.9 million houses were reported damaged. There was a need for supply of shelter kits, utensils, tarpaulins, lighting solutions for those who had fully or partially lost their houses. Heath facilities damaged in West Bengal by the cyclone included 563 primary health centres, 169 Block primary health centres and 5,142 sub-centres at the community level. The existing health systems were already overwhelmed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the damages due to the cyclone made this worse. The waterlogged areas with debris and other waste materials would accelerate the risk of water and vector-borne diseases. According to Need Assessment Working Group (NAWG) report dated 31 May, approximately 2.6 million people were affected, 205,368 houses were damaged, 55,767 houses were destroyed in the 19 affected districts in Bangladesh. Total 26 people lost their lives. In addition, 40,894 latrines; 18,235 water points; 32,037 hectares of crops and vegetable; 18,707 hector of fish cultivation area; 440 km of road and 76 km of embankment were damaged. Later in August, due to active monsoon conditions and lack of sustainable repair of embarkment, a strong tidal surge has given rise to the water levels of the Shibsa, Kapotakkho and Koyra in Khulna, rivers causing breaches in the protection embankments in the already disaster-stricken coastal district bordering the Bay of Bengal. Twelve villages in Koyra and Paikgachha upazila, which were already severely damaged by cyclone Amphan and tidal water, have once again been flooded by this tidal surge. Six months after the cyclone, villages in Satkhira, Khulna remain inundated as Water Development Board (WBD) yet to repair damaged embankments. As a result of broken embarkment, around 50,000 people have been severely affected in Koyra and Paikgachha upazilas under Khulna district. At least 15,000 people exposed to serious waterlogging issues. In Satkhira district, 375 acres of land inundated as Kholpetua River breaches embankment and flooding 250 acres of farmlands and fish enclosures in this low-lying villages due to Kopotakkho river embankment collapsed and waterlogged hundreds of families.\",\\n        \"interventions\": \"The Indian Meteorological Department issued an orange alert for the region, and a red alert for Gangetic West Bengal.

The current season is the second driest in 40 years. Iraq is anticipating a serious drought this summer following a particularly dry winter and reduced river flow caused by upstream damming programs by riparian countries. Climate change has potential impacts on food security such as reduction in wheat production, decrease in surface water storage, drying of shallower wells due to insufficient groundwater recharge, and an increase in the cost of water. If the dry conditions continue, and the water reservoirs are not replenished, the population will face an acute water shortage for irrigation of the next cropping season. In Iraq, large swathes of farmland, fisheries, power production and drinking water sources have been depleted of water. In the Ninewa governorate, wheat production is expected to go down by 70 per cent because of the drought, while in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq production is expected to decrease by half. Some families in Anbar who have no access to river water are spending up to USD80 a month on water. Temperatures are hitting record highs; last year saw Baghdad’s highest temperature ever of 52 degrees Celsius. WFP’s assessments revealed that the 2021 rainfall season has been below average, particularly in the northern governorates and Kurdistan Region. This could impact the final yield of the two major crops; wheat and barley. WFP’s May surveys noted that 8 percent of people in Ninewa and Kirkuk governorates have insufficient food consumption, twice as many as the 4 percent national average. Similarly, 13.4 percent of people in Ninewa reported employing negative coping strategies – such as borrowing money or eating less food – above the 7.5 percent national average. As consistently reported by UN Iraq, drought and water scarcity are pressing concerns, and the marshlands of southern Iraq are among the worst affected areas. With annual evaporation varying from 2.5 to 3 meters, and starkly reduced riverine flows supplying the marshlands, the area covered by water has been substantially reduced.

On 24 January 2020, the Ministry of Health and Population declared a national measles epidemic.\",\n",
       "   'interventions': \"A response plan and a resource mobilization strategy were developed with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and non-governmental organizations. The main action adopted in the response plan consisted of a national vaccination campaign targeting 2.65 million children aged between 6 months and 10 years, with an emphasis on the children aged 6 months up to 5 years, given their particular vulnerability. Due to the limited availability of vaccines and medical equipment, a difficulty which was further amplified by COVID-19, the vaccination campaign was planned in two phases: a first phase in February and March covered the 13 most affected health districts and a second phase followed in August in the remaining 22 health districts. After an initial phase between January and March, where measles cases continued to increase, a decrease was observed in the 13 health districts that had already implemented the immunization campaign. In September, a considerable drop in suspected cases was noted with less than 50 new infections per week in the last two weeks of the month.\",\n",

According to state media reports on 8 March, at least 30 people have been killed and 700 wounded in the explosions. These numbers are likely to increase as rescue teams continue to search for survivors. The explosions have caused widespread damage to residential buildings. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation has called for international support describing the situation as catastrophic. Medical and WASH support is urgently needed including mobile hospitals, medical and WASH equipment, and medicines. Temporary shelter, food assistance and psychological support for victims are also critical. A series of explosions on Sunday in Equatorial Guinea is now known to have killed 31 people, officials say. The number of those injured rose to 600. The blasts hit a military base in the country’s main city, Bata. Officials blame badly stored dynamite along with stubble burning by nearby farmers. Teams including volunteers continue to search the wreckage of buildings and homes for victims. There are fears the death toll could rise further as some victims may still be trapped. In a statement, President Obiang Nguema said the blasts had been caused “by the negligence of a unit charged with the care and protection of stores of dynamite and explosives” at the Nkoantoma military base. He said the base had “caught fire due to neighbouring farmers clearing farming land by setting it alight, leading to the explosion”. The president has appealed for international aid. The National Red Cross Society’s initial assessments identified at least 3,900 people (780 households) as directly affected, including 400 households (2,000 people) in Nkuantoma Military Camp, 100 households (500 people) in Mondong, 150 households (750 people) in Razel and 130 households (650 people) in Nkuantoma neighbourhood. This figure was corroborated by satellite imagery from UNOSAT issued on 13 March indicating that some 603 structures were damaged, 238 of which were destroyed and 365 severely or moderately damaged. Many people living within the vicinity of the military camps were able to return to their homes 72 hours after the explosions. However, multi-sectoral needs assessments planned to start from Monday 22 March by the UNDAC team and partners will determine the extent of the humanitarian impact. On 13th April, the Government of Equatorial Guinea, through the Emergency Committee, and the United Nations launched a coordinated Humanitarian Response and Recovery Plan for Equatorial Guinea following the tragic events of 7M. The Plan aims to provide urgent assistance to some 16,000 women, men, girls, boys and adolescents affected by the explosions through provisions of life saving support (food, health and WASH), as well as support the rapid restoration of access to basic services, support to recovery of livelihoods and rehabilitation of destroyed homes and/ public infrastructure.

The United Nations Resident Coordinator in Hanoi informs that UNDP organized a meeting with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) on 11 August 1998, attended by a number of UN agencies, diplomatic missions and IFRC. According to MARD, there have been two periods of drought since late 1997 to date: The first period, from late 1997 to May 1998 and the second, from June to the present. In the first period, more than 600,000 households or three million people were affected. Some 380,000 tonnes of paddy equivalent were destroyed. 11,400 ha were destroyed by forest fires due to the drought, and 19,360 ha of water areas used for aquatic production dried up. 274,000 households suffered from food shortage. Total economic losses were estimated at VND 5,290 billion (USD 407 million), excluding possible losses for future harvests due to a fall in production of some agricultural crops. Local authorities and people have spent about VND 515 billion (USD 40 million) for water supply, water pumping, temporary dams, channel dredging and well drilling, to combat the drought. In the second period, Central Viet Nam and Central Highlands are affected, including 13 provinces from Nghe An to Binh Thuan, with seven provinces severely affected, namely Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh. As of 10 August 1998, 66,000 ha of winter-spring rice were affected, of which 50,000 ha were totally destroyed.

Glenview, a high density suburb of Harare with an active trading area and a highly mobile population, is at the epicentre of the outbreak. The area is vulnerable to cholera because of inadequate supplies of safe piped water, which has led people to use alternative unsafe supplies such as wells and boreholes. Cases that are linked to the epicenter in Harare have been confirmed in 5 additional provinces. The outbreak has spread from Harare to Chitungwiza, and west to Gokwe and Bulawayo. Cholera is reportedly spreading to different areas of the country. Poor WASH and health infrastructure are facilitating the rapid spread of the disease.

Over the next 24 hours, MAN-YI is forecast to continue eastwards strengthening. On 15-16 November, it could turn north-eastwards and it could approach central and northern Philippines on 17 November as a very strong typhoon. MAN-YI will be the sixth tropical cyclone since 20 October which will affect the Philippines, particularly the central and northern regions. Tropical cyclone MAN-YI (named \"Pepito\" in the Philippines) crossed north-central Luzon after it made landfall in the vicinity of Dipaculao, north-eastern Central Luzon region as a typhoon with winds up to 259 km/h. On 18 November at 6.00 UTC, its centre was located over the South China Sea approximately 270 km west of Batac city, Ilocos Norte, with maximum sustained winds of 110 km/h (tropical storm).

Super Typhoon Man-yi, with sustained winds exceeding 185 km/h, made two landfalls—first in Panganiban, Catanduanes on 16 November, and subsequently in Dipaculao, Aurora Province the day after. More than 719,000 people were preemptively evacuated. As of 19 November, the government has reported 7 fatalities, 30 injuries, and 2 missing, reflecting the level of preparedness measures despite the strength of the storm. Most affected areas were still in the recovery phase from prior cyclones, compounding the challenges faced by affected communities. Man-yi is the sixth cyclone to traverse the Philippines in one month, has now weakened to a severe tropical storm and poses no further threat. The last three tropical cyclones (Toraji, Usagi and Man-yi) have affected more than 1.8 million individuals, equating to approximately 495,788 families across Regions 1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B and 5.

At least 25 people have been injured and 81 families affected. Damage has been reported to 19 houses. On 2-3 June, heavy to very heavy rain with thunderstorms is forecast over central and eastern Nepal, particularly over Province 1, Province 2, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province. Monsoon rainfall continues to have a localized impact. Search and rescue works are predominantly being carried out by federal government agencies. Total monsoon impacts across the country include: 783 displaced families sheltering in various public buildings, significantly increasing COVID-19 transmission risks, 25 deaths, 22 people missing and 1,153 affected families according to Ministry of Home Affairs and Initial Rapid Assessments. Heavy rain continues to affect most Districts of Nepal, causing floods, triggering landslides and leading to an increasing number of deaths and damage. The Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal reports 39 landslides and 16 flood events in the country over the past week. According to media reports, a total of 38 people have died, 24 are still missing and 51 have been injured. At least 1,250 people have been evacuated, 5,100 displaced and a total of 790 houses have been flooded. Light to moderate rain is forecast over most parts of the country on 7-8 July. The monsoon rain continues to affect most parts of Nepal, causing floods, triggering landslides, and resulting in an increasing number of casualties and damage. Over the last 7 days, 26 landslides and nine flood events have occurred in the country. According to national authorities and media reports, more than 50 people have died and almost 410 families have been affected. Monsoon rainfall continues to have a localized impact. Total monsoon impacts across the country include: 783 displaced families sheltering in various public buildings, significantly increasing COVID-19 transmission risks, 58 deaths, 34 people missing and 3,150 affected families according to Ministry of Home Affairs and Initial Rapid Assessments. Damages to the roads and trails particularly in the remote location of Darchula, Manang and northern Gorkha has posed challenges in transportation of relief materials. Monsoon rains have been light over 17-30 July, but to date monsoon related incidence have impacted 47 districts across the country. Displaced families are sheltering in various public buildings, increasing COVID-19 transmission risks and also posing challenges to meeting their basic needs. Flooding and landslide have caused damage to public and private infrastructures, including private houses. Road blockage, damages to the bridges along the road due to the flooding and landslide has posed logistics challenges in reaching out to the affected population. Since 20 August, heavy rain has been affecting various parts of Nepal, causing floods and landslides and resulting in casualties. According to the Nepal National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (DRR), at least 11 people have died, one is missing and up to 27 individuals have been injured. Damage has been reported to 89 houses and 177 families have been affected by floods or landslides. On 30-31 August, light to moderate rain is forecast over most of Nepal and locally heavy rain is expected over western and central Provinces, particularly in Bagmati Province, Gandaki, Lumbini and Sudur Pashchim Provinces. Floods and a landslide event occurred on 30 August in Darchula District (Sudurpashchim Province, far western Nepal), leading to fatalities. According to the Nepal National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (DRR) and media reports, three people died and two are missing. Several houses, buildings, two hydropower plants and five bridges have been damaged or destroyed. The monsoon rains that began in the last week of June have triggered flooding and landslides in many parts of the country, affecting around 10,000 families in 56 out of the country’s 77 districts. On 26 August, rainfall intensified for at least four consecutive days, with many rivers crossing warning levels, causing widespread inundation in many parts of the southern plains and reported incidents of landslides in the hilly region. As a result of this incessant rainfall, 11 districts (Myagdi, Rupandehi, Dang, Darchula, Sindhuli, Nawalparasi East, Nawalparasi West, Kanchanpur, Kailali, Udayapur and Mahottari) and 4,899 families were affected, including 2,129 who were temporarily displaced. In addition, government authorities have reported seven deaths and one missing person in recent days (as of 31 August 2021), while further assessment processes are underway. Many houses have been destroyed by the landslides and floods in specific pocket areas of several districts, and many displaced families are staying with relatives, while others have sought refuge in nearby schools and other temporary shelters. Similarly, displaced families have lost access to water points and sanitation facilities, increasing the risk of health problems, water-borne diseases, and the spread of COVID-19 infection in the community. With 35,591 active cases in the country, there is a high chance of COVID-19 transmission among people affected by the flood and landslide (daily infection rate is still around 20 per cent) either among those staying in home isolation or – most importantly – among those staying in evacuation centres. Severe weather including heavy rain and thunderstorms continues to affect parts of Nepal, causing floods and landslides and leading to casualties. The Nepal National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (DRR) reports that between 2-6 September, 13 people have died in Bagmati, Lumbini and Gandaki Provinces in central Nepal. More than ten individuals have been injured and one person is missing in Lumbini Province. Unusually heavy rainfall in a short period of time on September 6 has led to flooding in the city of Kathmandu, inundating more than 382 houses and several roads, local marketplaces, and parks. About 105 mm of rainfall was recorded in just three hours in Kathmandu. At least 138 people have been rescued by security forces. The most affected households are those living in informal settlements in low-lying areas of the city. The Bagmati River that flows through the city was at danger level, but the water level has receded. This follows heavy rainfall and floods in several areas across the Tarai Valley the previous week, which resulted in nine deaths, four missing people, five injured, and 756 people evacuated, with at least 42 houses completely damaged. Flash floods, floods and landslides caused by heavy rain have been affecting different parts of Nepal, leading to casualties. According to the latest report by NDRRMA, there are 32 dead and 43 missing people. Several Districts in Sudurpaschim Province (western Nepal) have been heavily affected, including Kanchanpur District, where the overflow of Mahakali River flooded several settlements, displacing more than 2,600 people. There has been extensive damage of the paddy crops which were ready to be harvested. Highways have been blocked by landslides in many places of the country. In the eastern parts of the country, two airports operations have been disrupted. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, however rescue efforts are hindered by severe weather conditions and the remoteness of the affected areas. In Nepal, based on the last Disaster Risk Reduction Portal (DRRP), there are 88 fatalities, 30 people still missing and 10 injured people across several Districts. On 21 October, the Prime Minister along with other ministers visited to the affected districts in the western region of the country. The local authorities provide the government relief assistance, that was announced on 20 October, directly to the affected households. Unseasonal heavy rains since 17 October brought floods and landslides across the country and have killed over 100 people. Heavy rains and floods have reportedly damaged rice paddy crops worth more than US$50 million. Roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure were also damaged. The impact of the floods, combined with existing livelihood setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a devastating impact on many communities in Nepal in the coming months. The impact of evacuations, collective sheltering, and rescue operations on COVID-19 transmission rates will be monitored over the coming weeks. According to the data of the Ministry of Home Affairs, between June to 27 October 2021, 673 people have lost their lives, 69 people are missing and 181 people are injured due to the water-induced disaster. Beyond the shelter and displacement related needs, the main impact for affected householders is on their livelihoods since this unforeseen recent rainfall happened during the end of the festival time and as the harvesting of crops was about to start. In some areas, between 60 to 80 per cent of the harvest was lost as per government preliminary data. According to a WFP 72h assessment report released on 28 October, it is estimated that the food security status of 77,635 people is significantly affected as a result of the flooding, of which 63,897 people, or 11,716 households, need immediate assistance.',\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'On 8 October 2021, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced that a new laboratory-confirmed case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) had been detected in Butsili Health Area, Beni Health Zone in North Kivu Province. Earlier this year, an EVD outbreak affected North Kivu Province which was declared over on 3 May 2021. Ebola vaccination began today in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s North Kivu Province where a case was confirmed on 8 October. People at high risk, including contacts of the confirmed case and first responders will receive the doses as the health authorities move to curb the spread of the virus. A total of five cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been confirmed in North Kivu province since 8 October 2021. Three people died and all cases are from a community in the Beni health zone. Ten patients are hospitalised, including two confirmed and eight suspected cases. 386 contacts have been established so far, with 322 followed in the last 24 hours and 140 people have been vaccinated so far. The index case, diagnosed on 8 October and deceased in a health facility, had three family members who died in September, but they were not investigated for Ebola. The detected Ebola strain is 96% similar to the one from the 10th EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2018-20). As of 24 October, six cases have been confirmed, the last case was reported on 22 October. All the cases have been from the Health Area of Butsili, Beni Health Zone: 4 people have died, and 2 people are currently in isolation at the temporary Ebola Treatment Center in the General Reference Hospital in Beni. Preliminary sequencing conducted indicates that this outbreak is likely linked to the 2018-2020 Nord Kivu/Ituri Ebola outbreak and was initiated by transmission from a persistently infected survivor or a survivor who experienced relapse. As of 31 October 2021, eight cases (5 female and 3 male) have been confirmed, the last case reported on 30 October 2021. Three Health Areas Butsili, Ngilinga, and Bundji have now reported cases, all of which within the Beni Health Zone. 6 people have died, 1 has tested negative and 1 currently still under treatment at the temporary Ebola Treatment Center in the General Reference Hospital in Beni. No new case of the Ebola virus disease has been recorded in the Beni Health Zone in North Kivu province in the past 16 days, the last confirmed case being on 30 October. The health response to the Ebola outbreak is currently focusing on community surveillance, which remains a major challenge with the low number of community alerts. The Ebola outbreak that erupted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s North Kivu Province in October – the second in 2021 – was today declared over, the national health authorities announced after no new cases were reported at the end of a 42-day countdown, or two incubation periods after the last confirmed case was discharged. In total, 11 cases (eight confirmed, three probable), including six deaths were reported in the outbreak that was declared on 8 October after a new case was confirmed in Beni health zone in the country’s North Kivu Province. This was the country’s 13th outbreak and occurred in the same area as the 2018 outbreak which lasted two years.',\n",

Based on initial reports and assessments, the provinces where most damage has been reported are Faryab province in the Northern region, Nangarhar province in the Eastern region, and Daikundi province in the Central Highlands region. This is the third time that the Northern region has experienced flooding in less than a month, with seven people killed and 384 families affected in heavy rains that occurred on 21 and 26-27 March. As of 30 March, there have been no reports of displacement due to the floods. The health facility in the Kamgal area suffered damage due to a landslide, impacting local access to essential health services. In Kunar, the primary route between Wama and Parun was temporarily obstructed on March 30 by rockslides, disrupting transportation and relief access. Similarly, in Nuristan, the Neshagram village road to Waygal district has been blocked due to landslides, severing the connection of approximately 1,000 to 2,000 families with essential services and the district center. Between 10 and 16 April 2024, Afghanistan experienced heavy rains and flash floods across the central, central highlands, northern, northeastern, southern and western regions. Preliminary reports indicate that almost 1,590 families have been affected, with 35 people killed and another 47 people injured, while 46 families have been displaced. The most severely affected provinces that had fatalities were Badghis (4), Farah (2), Hilmand (5), Kabul (3), Kandahar (4), Laghman (2), Nangahar (1), Parwan (2) and Uruzgan (12). Additionally, more than 930 houses have been destroyed (198) or damaged (738), along with around 63,700 acres of agricultural land and at least 470 livestock reportedly killed. A new wave of rains is expected in the central, south, southeast and southwest regions of the country over the next week, with up to 30 mm of rainfall daily. These volumes are of concern because water reserves are filled to capacity, thus flooding is to be anticipated. The humanitarian impact continues to rise following heavy rainfall and floods that have been affecting several provinces of Afghanistan, particularly Badghis, Uruzgan, Farah, Paktia, Zabul, Helmand, Kunar, Kabul, Badakhshan, Ghor, Kandahar, Takhar, Parwan, Herat, Ghazni, Laghman, Nimroz, and Sar-e-Pol. As of 23 April, media report at least 90 fatalities, and dozens of injured people. In addition, more than 2,000 houses have been damaged, and thousands of livestock have died across the country. On 10 and 11 May, heavy rainfall and flash floods struck northeastern Afghanistan, affecting 21 districts across Badakhshan (5), Baghlan (10) and Takhar (6) provinces. Initial reports indicate 180 fatalities and more than 240 injuries across the three provinces. 8,975 homes were either destroyed or damaged leaving thousands without shelter. In addition to damage and destruction to roads, bridges, and public schools, 11 health facilities across Baghlan and Takhar provinces have been affected disrupting health and nutrition services, and 4,260 livestock have been lost. Heavy rainfall in central Afghanistan has caused a new wave of flash floods on the 17 May 2024. This is while the country still reeling from last week's devastating floods. The newly affected provinces are Ghor, Faryad, Sar-e Pul, Samangan, Balkh and Badghis. On 17 and 18 May, heavy rainfall led to flash floods in the Northern and Western regions of Afghanistan, impacting 10 districts in Ghor province (Charsada, Dawlatyar, Dolayna, Ferozkoh, Lal Wa Sarjangal, Murghab, Pasaband, Saghar, Shahrak, and Tolak districts), as well as eight districts in Faryab province (Almar, Bilcheragh, Chehlgazi, Dawlatabad, Khaibar, Maimana, Pashtun Kot and Qaysar districts). While assessments are ongoing for both provinces, initial reports indicate the large-scale floods have resulted in the deaths of at least 120 people with hundreds more people missing and extensive damage to private properties and civilian infrastructure. Humanitarian partners and local authorities anticipate the number of casualties will increase significantly as search and rescue efforts continue amid reports that people may be trapped under collapsed buildings. In northern Afghanistan, the initial flooding on 17 May in Faryab province reportedly affected around 560 households followed by a second wave of flooding on 18 May which affected approximately 1,300 households across eight districts. Humanitarian partners are ramping up response efforts following 10 and 11 May heavy rainfall and flash floods in Baghlan, Badakhshan and Takhar provinces that affected more than 60,000 people. Across the region to date, approximately 7,800 homes have been confirmed as either destroyed or damaged leaving over 5,000 families displaced according to the Afghan Ministry of Refugee and Repatriation (MoRR). Across the three provinces, MoRR reported 347 people were killed and 1,651 injured due to floods. To date, 225 people have been confirmed killed (137 in the northeastern, 80 in the northern and eight in the western region); more than half of the deaths occurred in Baghlan Province alone. A further 217 people have been wounded. So far in 2024, more than 119,160 people have been affected by heavy rainfall and flash flooding across 32 provinces. On 23 June, two landslides occurred in Paktia province in eastern Afghanistan, one in Orgor village in Saskani district and another in Wazi Zadran, causing casualties and damage. According to media reports, as of 25 June, a total of 12 people died, of whom seven in Orgor village and five in Wazi Zadran district. Flash floods were reported in Guzargah district of Baghlan Province on 27 June, affecting two villages and destroying/damaging an estimated 150 homes, underscoring pervasive vulnerability to floods in this region. Access has been largely restored across affected areas, however the recent flash flood on 27 June has rendered some areas unreachable by responding agencies. Similarly, some areas in the Western region continue to remain inaccessible due to road conditions. Widespread damage to public infrastructure continues to be reported, including to roads, health centers, water networks, and education facilities. Moreover, more than 2,200 acres of land have been damaged in the Western region, while over 5,500 individuals supporting their families have lost access to livelihoods in the Northern and Northeastern regions. On 15 July, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms affected eastern Afghanistan, particularly Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, causing flash floods and leading to casualties and damage. According to media, at least 35 people died while 350 others were injured in Nangarhar province. In the neighbouring Kunar province, five people died following floods in Asadabad city and in Asmar district. The humanitarian impact is increasing following the flash flood events that affected the eastern provinces of Nangarhar, Kunar, and Laghman. According to Save the Children and media, the death toll reached 40 people while 350 others have been injured. In addition, 1,500 children have been displaced and 400 houses have been destroyed. Infrastructure damage has been also reported to telecommunications networks and several roads have also been blocked, making it difficult to access affected areas. To date, the number of reported casualties has increased to 58 fatalities and 380 injured. So far, joint assessment teams (JATs) have assessed 1,925 affected families across Nangarhar, Kunar, and Laghman provinces; further assessments are ongoing. The number of tents destroyed in the Omari camp near the reception center at the Torkham border crossing point has increased from 400 to 550. Severe damage has also been sustained to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities. On 20 August 2024, heavy rains triggered flash floods which swept through Panjshir, Parwan, Kabul, Nangarhar and Kunar province in the eastern and central regions of Afghanistan. The incident affected a total of 1,006 families comprising 6,589 individuals, especially in Jalalabad and Kabul where the highest number of affected populations and damaged shelters were reported. Since early April, preliminary data compiled by the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) indicates that approximately 40,500 homes have been affected, along with substantial loss of life and injuries reported in various provinces. Provinces such as Baghlan, Ghor, and Helmand have experienced particularly high numbers of fatalities and injuries, with the total death toll in the region reaching at least 300. While Ghor and Helmand reported significant injuries, other provinces, including Panjsher, Kapisa, Bamyan, Nimroz, Paktya, and Kunduz, reported no casualties. In the month of November, Afghanistan experienced significant natural disasters, particularly due to heavy rainfall and subsequent flash floods. On November 23, heavy rainfall led to flash floods that severely impacted several districts in Kunduz, Baghlan, and Balkh provinces, resulting in the deaths of two children aged 10 months and one year. In terms of damages to infrastructure, approximately 460 houses, including mosques and madrasas, were destroyed. Approximately 30 drinking water wells were destroyed, increasing the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases.\",\n",

The situation, which is still unfolding, has caused internal displacement and homelessness. Indeed, over 100 severely injured people have been recorded as a result of fallen walls and trees. On 8 July, the Head of State summoned an emergency meeting while the windstorm was still ongoing, requesting for support from all well-wishers for the affected communities. As the storm continues, ten deaths have been confirmed as a result of collapsed buildings. According to the Meteorological Department, on 7 July, the windspeed was at 85 km per hour and was the first of its kind to be recorded in the last five years. The unfolding disaster has already caused considerable damage on the lives and livelihoods of the people. Many affected people have “no place to live and nothing to eat” said the Executive Director of National Disaster Management Agency (NMDA) at a press briefing at their head office in Kanifing on 8 July 2021 at 3:00pm, attended by the Gambia Red Cross Society (GRCS) Secretary General and essential staff. The GRCS, the NDMA and other partners immediately launched a joint rapid assessment which is still ongoing. Preliminary information as of 12 July 2021 from an assessment indicates that more than 16,849 people (approximately 1,057 households) are affected, including more than 1,531 internally displaced persons (IDPs), among whom many are currently being sheltered by relatives and host families. Preliminary information reports the destruction of several houses, schools and health centres and community seed storage facilities in some of the affected villages. However, in the process of developing the Emergency Plan of Action many more reports are indicating a sharp increase in the number of affected people and households throughout the country. The GRCS has consequently deployed rapid assessment teams to the affected areas/regions. The National Society (NS) is conducting initial distribution of household items to the most vulnerable and dignity packs alongside the assessment exercise. The Gambia has a sub-tropical climate with sunshine throughout the year with average temperatures between 29°C and 34°C. The rainy season runs from June to September and sometimes beyond. The country has experienced over the past few years extensive downpours causing severe destruction as a result of poor draining systems, afforestation, felling of trees for new settlements (new estate developers) etc., causing floods, destruction and untold suffering. The rainy/farming season has just begun with forecasts indicating intermitted heavy rainfall accompanied by severe windstorms. These imminent precipitations may further complicate the situation and severe consequences on the rural population in particular are expected. Twelve people have so far died and more than 109,000 people were affected by the windstorm and flash flood which hit Gambia on 7 July. More losses to food stocks have been recorded, with farmers experiencing erratic rainfalls, requiring increased preparedness by the government and partners related to food security.',\n",

Following investigations, it was determined that the initial cases started after a communal meal and the outbreak was subsequently sustained by poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) conditions in the affected areas. Environmental samples collected by the investigational teams demonstrated that a river shared by both counties was contaminated by surface water runoff which was thought to be soiled by human waste due to widespread open defecation in the vicinity. Since January 2019, nine of the 47 Counties of Kenya reported cholera cases, namely: Kajiado, Nairobi, Garissa, Machakos, Mandera, Embu, Narok, Wajir, and Mombasa Counties. The outbreak remains active in six Counties: Nairobi, Garissa, Kajiado, Wajir, Mombasa and Machakos.

Cholera outbreaks have also been reported with a total of 10 counties being affected since the beginning of the year. Over the same period, a total of 3,847 cases have been reported out of which 163 were confirmed. Some 26 deaths have been reported, a case fatality rate of 0.7 percent.

Initial assessments indicate that the major drivers of the current increased malaria transmission include low use of preventive measures (coverage of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets stands at less than 50% after the last universal distribution campaigns in 2017); low population immunity in the wake of increased mobility, especially for the people living in the mountains where malaria transmission is usually very low; climatic changes and vector ecological and behavioural changes (increased vector density and feeding habits – biting both indoors and outdoors as well as higher vector aggressiveness). The national malaria outbreak response plan, which is currently being validated, has highlighted a lack of human, logistical and financial resources for effective response. All stakeholders, including the national authorities and partners are called upon to provide the requisite resources to mount a robust response to this event before it escalates. The number of health districts that have passed the epidemic threshold has continued to increase in May. Nine health districts are above the alert threshold and thirty-three are above the epidemic threshold.

Some 18,600 families have been affected by the earthquake, of which 6,255 households are in Category A (more than 80 percent destroyed) and 12,037 in Category B (between 50 and 80 percent destroyed).

The deep depression was moved along the coast of the eastern and northeastern parts of the country, and it was located approximately 100 km northeast of Trincomalee district on 27 November 2024. On 29 November 2024, the Department of Meteorology issued a ‘Red’ alert warning for Cyclone “Fengal” over the Southwest Bay of Bengal for the land and the deep and shallow sea areas around the island. As per the warning, the deep Depression over Southwest Bay of Bengal moved north-northwestwards and intensified into a cyclonic storm “Fengal” and was located about 280 km northeast of Kankasanthurai and 310 km north-northeast of Trincomalee. Due to the extreme weather conditions caused by Storm Fengal, rainfall exceeding 200 mm has been recorded in the Eastern, Northeastern, North Central, and Northern Provinces. Very strong winds, reaching speeds of up to 60 km/h, have caused damage to infrastructure, homes, and agricultural lands in these areas. Furthermore, the intensity of flooding has increased due to the release of water from medium-sized reservoirs, leading to a significant influx of flash floods. 46 minor to medium reservoirs in the Eastern and Northern provinces reported damage. Additionally, the level 2 spill gates of major reservoirs in the Ampara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Mullaitivu, and Anuradhapura districts were opened to release excess water, which resulted in further damage to small bridges and canals in many areas. The Disaster Management Centre reports that, as of 29 November, 441,373 individuals have been affected across 232 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in 24 districts due to the indirect impacts of Cyclone Fengal.

The number of new cases has been gradually increasing since week 1 of 2020, when 127 suspected cases were reported. From weeks 1-6, 2020, a cumulative total of 1 276 suspected measles cases, including 14 deaths (case fatality ratio 1.1%), have been reported from 52 (41%) out of 126 districts of the country. The measles outbreak in Chad has been ongoing since 2018. In 2019, a total of 26 623 suspected measles cases, including 259 deaths (case fatality ratio 1.0%) were reported from 36 districts. In week 8 (week ending 23 February 2020), 621 suspected cases were reported. 29 districts were in the epidemic phase in week 8. Since the beginning of the year, a total of 2 410 suspected cases and 23 deaths (CFR 1.0%) have been reported from Beboto, Kyabe, Goundi, Korbol, Kelo and Guelao. As attention and resources are shifting more and more towards COVID-19 prevention and response activities in Chad, the country is still grappling with a persistent measles epidemic that shows no signs of slowing down. 118 out of 126 health districts in Chad have been affected since the epidemic outbreak in May 2018, with southern provinces facing a rapid increase in cases. As of 30 April 2020, 28 health districts were in a declared measles epidemic. The Ministry of Public Health reported 7,635 suspected cases, with the highest number of registered cases in Beboto, Kyabe and Goundi health districts. In February, and before the first COVID-19 case in Chad was confirmed on 19 March, a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) emergency response team travelled to measles-affected regions, including Bebote, which is the most heavily impacted. As a result, 25,177 children aged between six months and nine years were vaccinated against measles. As of 25 October, 8,601 suspected cases of measles and 39 deaths have been notified in 100 out of 126 districts (during the same period in 2019, the tally was 25,283 suspected cases and 242 deaths). However, a period of higher transmission of the disease is expected. This is prompting the planning of a vaccination campaign in epidemic-prone health districts. Two national campaigns are envisaged, requiring funding of 3 million USD, of which 2 million are available through GAVI funds.',\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'On 26 June, the Ulawun volcano in East New Britain erupted and began emitting ash plumes up to 20,000 metres. About 12,000 people in West New Britain and 4,000 people in East New Britain have been affected by the eruption. About 6,800 people have evacuated and are in two care centres in West New Britain. The volcanic activity is subsiding, and the alert level is expected to be lowered from level 2 to 1. Between 3,000 and 5,000 people voluntarily evacuated the immediate vicinity of Ulawun. The ash plume is moving generally south but has slowed in recent hours. Air Niugini has cancelled flights to Hoskins Airport until further assessments are made. The cluster system is to be activated in response to food, water, shelter and non-food item needs among the evacuees. As the area has been cut off from the highway, relief items will be transported by road from Kimbe to Bialla, and then via helicopter to those affected. Approximately 10,620 people have congregated in at least ten care centre sites, according to local-level government authorities in Bialla, West New Britain. Another 427 people are in a single care centre in East New Britain. No casualties have been reported. Ashfall has been observed across Talesea District, and down to Kimbe. The authorities in West New Britain have declared a provincial state of emergency and have activated their emergency response plan for Mt. Ulawun, including the establishment of a forward base in Bialla. All communities within a 20-kilometre radius of the volcano were instructed to relocate to designated safe zones. Hoskins airport was opened at 17:00 today by the airport authority, National Airports Corporation. It is expected that Air Niugini flights will resume over the weekend pending an air quality assessment. As of 2 July, approximately 13,250 people have congregated in at least 9 care centre sites in West New Britain. Two people have been reportedly sustained light injuries during the relocation. Overcrowding has been observed in the care centre sites. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a large number of people are staying in open areas without shelter, minimal food supplies, with limited access to clean drinking water, latrines, and sanitation. There are public health risks of vector-borne diseases, measles, and other vaccine-preventable and diarrhoeal diseases. Due to heavy ashfall remaining on the runway, Air Niugini flights into Hoskins Airport were cancelled again as of 1 July until a further review is undertaken by the airline. As of 5 July, there is an estimated 7,318 people staying in seven evacuation sites in West New Britain Province, and 2,538 people are staying in one evacuation site in East New Britain Province, according to IOM displacement profiles. In West New Britain, 86 per cent of those displaced are staying in the government-run care centres, with around 16 per cent staying in open spaces or with no shelter. Five of the six sites reported health-related concerns, including malaria and coughs and only one site was reported to have health services. In East New Britain, around 85 per cent of people displaced are living in makeshift shelters. The site was reported to lack functioning toilets or separate bathing facilities and the primary source of drinking water are nearby streams. Reported health problems include malaria and diarrhoea; there are no health services available near the site. As of 12 Jul, the Rabaul Volcanological Observatory’s (RVO) preliminary assessment indicates that people evacuated in East New Britain Province may return home immediately, while those evacuated in West New Britain Province may be able to return home in a week’s time. The alert level remains at 1, indicating a low threat to life. West New Britain provincial authorities have downgraded the State of Emergency on 12 July, noting that it would be scaling down operations and officers would be returning to their normal duties. Gaps remain in addressing evacuees’ needs at care centres, apart from food. A major concern remains the risk of disease outbreaks due to a lack of access to water, poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, and general living conditions at the care centres and other evacuation sites. A government assessment of communities home to approximately 7,500 people, showed nearly all household food gardens were covered in ash and likely lost. Schools, due to resume on 8 July, remained suspended. Evacuees are still located in informal sites along the Pandi River. Access to clean water and sanitation and hygiene continue to be priorities, as well as a growing need to address psychosocial issues and establish safe recreational zones for children and support programs for women. The Government has distributed US$66,700 worth of food relief to evacuation sites, and public health authorities have provided medical assistance. In-country support from humanitarian partners has included provision of food, emergency shelter items and non-food items, essential medicines and supplies, and nutritional supplements. Ulawun volcano, on the island of New Britain, erupted on 3 August, producing a short but strong eruption with a 100 metre fire fountain and an 19,000 metre ash plume. Further imminent eruptions are unlikely and as of 5 August, the risk level, which was at ‘Stage 3’, has been downgraded to ‘Stage 1.’ Communities to the west and southwest of the volcano, such as Navo, Kabaya and Kimbe, have been most severely affected. A response team from the West New Britain Provincial Disaster Centre is supporting ongoing relief operations and conducting an assessment on the impact of the ashfall. Approximately 8,000 people remain displaced following earlier eruptions of Ulawan in June, with many of the displaced people still living in care centres. Ulawun erupted at about 5:00 a.m. local time (UTC+10) on 1 October, following a swarm of seismic activity that began around 11:30 a.m. local time on 30 September. The eruption was visible from red incandescent glow shooting up less than 100m from the base and an ash plume rising less than 1,000 metres. Preliminary observations suggest areas in the westerly direction may be affected by ashfall, but the current level of exposure to ashfall remains low. The West New Britain Provincial Disaster Centre reported that 6 care centres are open for evacuating residents. As of two weeks ago, approximately 6,200 people were staying in the care centres, which had remained open since the previous eruptions. Following the Mount Ulawun eruption on 1 October, the volcanic explosion activity continues, the ash plume rose 6,100 m altitude and is moving in south-west direction at 37 km/h. The eruption has forced the evacuation of several people who recently returned to their homes, following a previous eruption and evacuation. As of 10.00 a.m. local time on 2 October, the eruption of Ulawun continues via a new vent, low on its south-west flank. The alert level remains at stage 3, indicating a high threat to life. Seismicity remains high with tremors of similar intensity or slightly above. If the eruption continues, or the lava effusion rate increases, areas to the north-west of the current vent may be affected. Ash can be expected in down-wind areas. The activity of Mount Ulawun (West New Britain Province, New Britain island) is slightly decreasing since the ash plume rose approximately 3,000 m. According to media, people living close to the volcano have been preventively evacuated. The Manam volcano (Manam island) located 700 km west of Mount Ulawun began to erupt on 28 September and, as of 2 October, the ash column has risen to 3,000 m. There are no reports of any casualties or damage. According to the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, as of 2 October, a red aviation color code has been issued both for Ulawun and Manam. Mount Ulawun in West New Britain erupted on 1 October. Eruptions continued for several days, sending ash several kilometres in the air. Lava flowed up to 3km from the north-west side of the vent, but the lava flow did not cause any damage to life or property. On 7 October, the Rabaul Volcanological Observatory (RVO) lowered the alert level to Stage 2. Seven care centres, hosting around 6,200 people from previous eruptions, remain open in the area, providing food assistance to those displaced.',\n",

The floods displaced approximately 1,800 households in Bor South and submerged crops in Duk. The NOAA/NCEP Global Ensemble Forecast System shows a sustained likelihood of heavy rainfall through August 10, 2020, in eastern South Sudan. Although the scale of flooding is lower in 2020 compared to 2019 so far, a consecutive year of flood-induced crop and livestock losses in low-lying areas along the Nile River and Pibor-Akobo-Sobat basin would exacerbate existing food insecurity into the post-harvest period. Engineering troops serving with the UN Mission in South Sudan are engaged in an ongoing battle against flooding caused by broken dykes in Bor, in Jonglei, aggravated by heavy downpours. Across the state, primarily in Bor South and Twic East, some 135,000 people are believed to be displaced. The situation is worsened by the onset of the rainy season, which has led to the displacement of over 5,000 people due to floods in Bor South and Twic East counties in Jonglei. According to local authorities, the number goes up to 150,000 for eastern Jonglei. Heavy rainfall has been affecting central and eastern States of the country (in particular Jonglei, Eastern Nile, and Pibor States) since late July, causing the White Nile River, and the Akobo River to overflow, triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. In Jonglei State, media report as of 14 August, around 200,000 displaced people, and thousands of destroyed houses across Bor South, Twic East, Duk, and Ayod Counties. In the eastern part of Upper Nile State, approximately 30,000 people were reported affected across the Renk County. In Pibor state, a number of families were reported displaced throughout Pochalla County. More than 600,000 people have been affected by flooding in areas along the White Nile since July, with Jonglei and Lakes the worst affected states. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the centre of the country. The majority of people displaced moved to higher ground near their homes and plan to return once the flood waters recede. In Bor South, over 33,000 people earlier displaced by conflict and flooding in Twic East and Duk counties to the north have moved west into Awerial county, and are now sheltering in Mingkaman town IDP settlement. Widespread flooding continued in October, affecting over half of the country and disrupting the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people. An estimated 856,000 people were affected by flooding since July with some 400,000 people displaced. An estimated 1,042,000 people have been affected by floods in South Sudan. Jonglei State and the Greater Pibor Administrative Area are the worst affected (a total of 495,000 people affected). Flood-affected people’s urgent needs include food and livelihood support, emergency shelter and non-food items (ES/NFI), and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health and protection services.

The bad weather damaged 2,214 tents inhabited by 2,329 households in Atme, Sarmada, Deir Hassan, Al-Dana, and Al-Bab. In response, QRCS\\'s representation mission in Gaziantep, Turkey, activated its disaster information center to manage the emergency response. It coordinates with United Nations agencies, as well as local and international relief providers, to monitor the movement of IDPs, evacuate the submerged camps, and secure transportation and shelter. Lebanon started feeling the effects of a heavy storm on Sunday 6 January 2019. Heavy rain, high winds and colder temperatures were reported all over Lebanon. Some regions were affected by either floodings, erosions or heavy snow. This situation reports highlights the impact of the storm on Syrian refugees and response that followed. 50,000 refugees living in around 850 informal settlements could be affected by floodings. The impact of the storm ‘Norma’ has necessitated the activation of an extreme weather response over the weekend following referrals received and forecast indicating a drop in temperatures, with snowfall at lower altitudes. Assessment of damage is underway and response has started to affected areas. Extreme weather response is being coordinated by MoSA and UNHCR through the Inter-Agency coordination mechanism. At minimum 66 informal settlements have been found heavily impacted by the flooding, 15 of which have been completely flooded or collapsed. Around 300 refugees have been relocated so far in the North and the Bekaa. No injuries or casualties have been reported to date. Storm \"Norma\" has caused damages to infrastructure, roads and homes across Lebanon, putting at least 70,000 refugees at risk, more than half of whom are children, based on the latest humanitarian update. \"The storm has caused the collapse of many tents and flooding of several informal settlements to the points that refugees had to evacuate to alternative locations,\" says Giovanni Rizzo, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s (NRC) Area Manager in Bekaa. At least 700 Syrian refugees have been evacuated and 900 Syrian refugees are displaced by the impact of the storm.

The storm caused widespread damage in multiple provinces, with Quang Ninh and Hai Phong provinces, where wind speeds reached 213 km/h, being the most affected. 58 fatalities and 40 missing persons reported, with 746 people injured due to landslides and flash floods. Over 52,000 individuals evacuated due to severe flooding and landslides, with relocations focused on coastal and high-risk areas, including 96 households in Binh Lieu District of Quảng Ninh province. Approximately 184,000 hectares of rice, secondary crops and fruit trees were damaged or flooded, 47,566 houses damaged or destroyed, and significant damage to power infrastructure, bridges, and educational facilities. Heavy rains from typhoon Yagi's remnants have impacted the Philippines, Viet Nam, Northern Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar. Millions are affected in all five countries. In Viet Nam, over 150 deaths and 9,500 houses have been damaged. Two million school children face disrupted learning. In Thailand, severe weather in Northern Thailand has caused significant flooding and landslides affecting about 14,328 households. Rescue teams are responding to the flood situation. In Laos, floods in Luang Namtha province are affecting 40,255 people. Heavy rainfall has also triggered floods in northern Myanmar especially in Tachileik at the border with Thailand. The Mekong river is expected to reach danger levels in Laos and Cambodia. Five days after Typhoon Yagi struck northern Viet Nam, the country is facing severe flooding and landslides as a result of heavy and prolonged rains. As of 12 September, at least 199 people are reported dead with 128 people missing. Approximately 3 million people have no access to safe drinking water and sanitation, causing risk of disease, and 550 health facilities and more than 800 schools have been damaged. Following Typhoon Yagi’s landfall on 7 September, heavy rains and flooding have severely impacted northern and central provinces in Lao PDR, with nearly 140,000 people affected. The worst-hit areas include Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, and Vientiane Capital, along with significant impacts in Phongsaly, Oudomxay, Bokeo, Xiengkhouang, and Xayaboury. A total of 32 districts, 486 villages, and 27,972 families (139,826 people, including 59,662 women) have been affected, with 443 families evacuated and three confirmed fatalities. Current reports show floods have damaged 3,167 hectares of paddy fields, 121 houses, 41 roads, and 7 health facilities, while actual numbers are likely to be far higher. Viet Nam: On 16 September, the VDDMA reported 291 fatalities, 38 people missing and 237,000 homes damaged as a result of the typhoon, rains and landslides. An additional 84,000 homes were flooded, and 1,530 schools and 570 health facilities were damaged. According to the Minister of Planning and Investment, initial damage assessments from the typhoon amounted to VNĐ40 trillion ($1.6 billion) in damages. Some three million people are affected, including 1.3 million people in 26 provinces who suffered from damaged and flooded homes. Since 9 September, heavy rains caused by the monsoon season and remnants of Typhoon Yagi have led to severe flooding across Myanmar. Central Myanmar is currently the hardest hit. The flood impacted 59 townships in nine regions and states, including the state’s capital, Nay Pyi Taw, Bago, Kayah, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, and eastern and southern Shan. There has been significant damage to road networks, transportation, telecommunications, and electricity in affected areas. Most areas remain flooded, although some townships have started to see receding water levels. While data verification is challenging, an estimated 631,000 people might have been affected by flooding across the country. Myanmar: As of 17 September, there has been 113 reported deaths. In Mandalay, more than 53,000 people were affected in Yamethin. The Sa Mone Dam breach flooded 12 villages, submerged 40,000 acres of farmland, and left 10,000 people in urgent need of aid. Flooding in Bago worsened in Taungoo Township, surpassing August flood levels and affecting 1,200 households. In total more than 87,000 people affected in six townships in Bago Region. In Eastern Shan, flash floods destroyed a key bridge, disrupting transportation and communication. Southern Shan faced widespread flooding, affecting 13 townships, with more than half the area inundated, including tourism infrastructure. In the Southeast, Mon, Kayin, and Kayah states experienced severe flooding, displacing people and damaging infrastructure, particularly in IDP camps and low-lying areas. In Nay Pyi Taw, four townships were heavily flooded, affecting around 60,000 people. As of 27 September, the severe floods caused more than 360 fatalities, with more than 100 people missing and 320,000 people displaced, forcing them into temporary camps/evacuation centres that were often overcrowded and lacked sufficient access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities. Likewise, the floods and landslides caused the destruction of more than 141,000 buildings, including homes, schools, offices, and critical infrastructure, such as 533 roads and bridges. Furthermore, several concurrent low-pressure systems around Bay of Bengal resulted in persistent rains, leading to additional flooding. In the beginning of October, recurrent flooding impacted Mandalay region, Eastern and Southern Shan states, disrupting needs analysis, relief deliveries, and humanitarian assistance efforts, while compounding the needs of the vulnerable population affected by multiple hazards. Local markets, health facilities, and homes were devastated, significantly reducing access to food, water, and medical supplies. In Lao PDR, Tropical Cyclone Yagi and the Southwest Monsoon have affected 1,208 villages across 106 districts in 15 provinces, including Vientiane Capital and Borikhamxay. According to the NDMO Lao PDR, the cyclone and monsoon have resulted in seven fatalities and impacted approximately 185,800 people (76,100 families). The estimated cost of damages stands at around 7.9 million USD, with significant destruction including 252 road sections, 77 schools, 11 health facilities, 298 houses, and 24,600 hectares of agricultural land. An estimated 48,500 children have been impacted, with at least 24,000 children in need of critical support. Approximately 92,000 people are in need of water, sanitation, and health services; 10,000 children and adolescents affected by the floods are in need of community-based mental health and psychosocial support activities. Some 3.6 million people in nearly half (26) of Viet Nam’s 63 provinces and cities were affected by the typhoon and subsequent floods and landslides. Across the country, more than 240,599 homes, 1,530 schools, and 570 health facilities were damaged, with another 73,248 homes submerged in floodwaters. More than 72,500 people are estimated to be in need of safe shelter as a result of destroyed or severely damaged homes. About 570,000 people, including approx.163,020 children, are in need of assistance. The hardest-hit areas include rural, ethnic minorities and low-income communities where children were already facing multiple challenges. Typhoon Yagi was recorded as the strongest typhoon Viet Nam has experienced in the past 30 years. It affected the entire northern region, home to a population of 19 million. Among the 12 most damaged provinces, Lao Cai, Tuyen Quang, and Yen Bai have declared a state of emergency. As of 27 September 2024, the typhoon resulted in 318 deaths, 26 missing persons, 1,976 injuries, the evacuation of over 130,000 people, and initial damages amounting to more than VND 81,000 billion (approximately CHF 2,43 billion), as reported in the conference on “Preliminary, evaluating, learning experiences on the prevention and overcoming of the consequences of typhoon No. 3” chaired by the Prime Minister of Viet Nam and attended by the leaders of ministries, branches, 26 provinces and cities. The typhoon left a trail of devastation, affecting public and private properties, including offices, schools, and buildings, many of which suffered roof damage, while large areas experienced disruptions to telecommunications and power. As of 23 October, the Viet Nam Disaster and Dyke Management Authority (VDDMA) reported 321 deaths, 24 people missing, and 1,978 people injured. Many homes, healthcare facilities, schools were also damaged because of Typhoon Yagi and subsequent rains and landslides. The Typhoon affected 3,6 million people across 26 provinces, with the response prioritizing 1,6 million people in 11 provinces. Efforts are focused on reaching 570,000 individuals in need, targeting 300,000 in the three hardest-hit provinces: Yen Bai, Lao Cai, and Cao Bang. Following the devastation caused by Typhoon Yagi—one of the most powerful storms to hit Southeast Asia in decades – heavy rains have continued to batter many of the hardest-hit areas. Needs assessments reveal that over 5.6 million people, including at least 1.6 million children, were directly affected by the resulting floods and landslides across Viet Nam, Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Thailand. The disaster has severely disrupted access to clean water, essential social services, education, healthcare, food, and shelter, leaving millions in urgent need of assistance. [In Vietnam], three months after the typhoon children and families in affected areas still face acute deprivations and risks. Health and water systems remain damaged, denying 570,000 people access to safe drinking water and clean sanitation, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks and interruptions to routine immunization. About 220,000 children under five and 70,000 pregnant and lactating women remain at risk of malnutrition due to disrupted health and other services, food shortages and lack of clean water. Over 830,000 children in the worst-affected areas experienced a loss of 60-120 hours of learning and are being impacted by the damage to school infrastructure and learning materials. Disruptions of education in typhoon-affected regions, which already have lower learning outcomes, are increasing existing disparities, especially among ethnic minority children.\",\n",

This event primarily impacted the Marshall Islands, particularly the Roi Namur Islet in the northern sector of Kwajalein Atoll, which is part of the US Military base. Notably, this incident involved weather-driven waves and inundation, distinct from a tsunami. The powerful winds associated with the storm system generated a substantial swell that affected Roi-Namur and other areas such as Arno Atoll and the runway in Ailinglapalap. There are suspicions that additional islands and atolls (namely: Jaluit, Arno, Namu, Alinglaplap, Wotje, Jabot, Namdrik, Kili, Kwajalein) may have been affected, although ground reports are limited and experiencing delays due to communication and infrastructure challenges. Collectively, a total of 19,532 people live on those islands. In the neighboring Federated State of Micronesia (FSM), islands also encountered inundation, leading to evacuations from coastal areas in Kosrae. According to information from NOAA, this event appears to be more severe than the flood in December 2008 that affected RMI and is comparable to the December 2021 King Tide inundation event across the FSM.',\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'The Philippines: Tropical Cyclone Noru (\"Karding\" in the Philippines) formed over the western Philippines Sea on 22 September and started moving west toward northern Luzon Island. On 23 September at 0.00 UTC, its centre was located approximately 1,000 km east of the coast of Cagayan Valley Region, with maximum sustained winds of 74 km/h (Tropical Storm). On 25 September, Noru attained super typhoon strength while it continued to move westward towards the eastern seaboard. It marked one of the fastest rapid intensifications ever recorded in the Pacific basin. After Noru swept through Luzon on 25 and 26 September, response and clearing operations were underway. As one of the strongest typhoons to have formed this year, preliminary information from the affected areas of Quezon and Aurora provinces indicates destructive wind damage in some areas of initial landfall, possibly affecting majority of houses in Polillo Islands. The storm also brought torrential rains with parts of Bulacan and Pampanga currently inundated with flood waters from the Sierra Madre Mountain range and the nearby dams. As per initial government data, more than 2,400 families were pre-emptively evacuated. Thirty-four evacuation centers are operational, with reports of some evacuees already heading home. Five casualties have been reported so far, all of whom were rescuers on patrol from the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office of Bulacan. On 27 September, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported 60,817 affected people and 51,811 displaced in 976 evacuation centres and outside. These numbers went up on the 29th, with more than 714,200 people (195,900 families) affected in the Regions I, II, III, CALABARAZON, V and CAR. According to government reporting, the number of casualties has increased to eight, with five still missing. While most of those that preemptively evacuated have by now headed home, 22,800 persons remain displaced, 11,800 of whom are taking temporary shelter in 127 still open evacuation centres and the rest staying with relatives or friends. Most of those displaced reside in Region 3, where the storm made its second landfall. With more than 20,600 houses reportedly damaged, 2,500 of which are totally damaged, repairs will need to be made due to the possibility of more storms entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility in the coming weeks and months. Around 46,400 people remained displaced, with 3,091 people in 26 evacuation centers. Severe winds damaged 58,994 houses (51,600 partially, 7,344 totally damaged), while torrential rains left parts of Bulacan province underwater. As of 3 Oct, five people remain missing and 12 people have been confirmed dead, five of whom were emergency responders. The Department of Agriculture estimated that around 170,700 hectares of agricultural areas had been damaged, equivalent to USD $52.8 million in losses. A situational report was published on 26 September and on the same day, PRC decided to request Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) support from the IFRC due to uncovering the extent of the damage left behind by Typhoon \"Karding\".',\n",

During this period two deaths have been reported in Jaffna district and the Government of Sri Lanka has declared a local level emergency in the Northern Province, hence schools and other institutions in the province were closed. The continuous rains are still inundating most of the low-lying areas in the two districts and have caused damages to residential areas. As this situation is intensifying, agricultural lands and standing crops are also inundated and damaged as well as the infrastructures. As of 10th December, It is expected that this heavy rainfall is going to continue, which will have an impact and further exacerbate the capacity of vulnerable households in the affected areas. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) situation report, as of 8 December 2020, 111,659 people (33,316 families) have been affected across 14 districts.

According to the country’s Emergency Operations Centre, the extreme weather has left at least 21 people dead and forced more than 13,000 people to evacuate. At least 15 electricity circuits and 115 aqueducts have been affected, causing disruptions in electricity service for more than 150,000 people and water service for some 1.8 million people. The National Institute of Drinking Water and Sewage and EDESUR are working to restore their respective services in the affected areas. According to preliminary reports, more than 1,500 homes, 6 roads and 5 bridges have been affected. Some 19 communities remain cut off due to the overflow of rivers. Fourteen provinces (Pedernales, San Juan, Barahona, Azua, San José de Ocoa, Bahoruco, Independencia, Elías Piña, San Cristóbal, Peravia, Sánchez Ramírez, El Distrito Nacional, Santo Domingo and Duarte) across the country remain at a red alert level due to the risk of further flooding and landslides. Heavy rainfall is forecast to continue through until 20 November. As of 21 November, severe rains and subsequent flooding have left 24 people dead, displaced nearly 18,000 people, affected 3,500 homes, and cut off some 45 communities. About 1.1 million people are still without access to safe water. The UN is also helping the Ministry of Health with the procurement of 50,000 cholera vaccine doses after authorities detected 16 cases, 12 among Haitian migrants. There are concerns that damages to water management systems may aggravate an ongoing dengue outbreak that has led to 12,000 cases so far in 2023. According to information from 22 November, 7,412 homes were affected, 14 partially affected and 22 were destroyed. At least 37,060 people were displaced to safe areas and 55 communities are isolated. A total of 4 shelters were opened, housing 158 people, and 59 water services were affected, of which 55 are inoperable. Almost three weeks after intense rainfall and flooding hit the Dominican Republic on 17 and 18 November, a Damage and Needs Assessment conducted in North Santo Domingo and the province of Duarte indicates that populations in the most affected communities require food, clean water, hygiene and sanitation supplies, medicines, and the repair or reconstruction of homes. According to estimations from the government’s social protection system (SIUBEN), the flooding affected at least 340,000 people in the provinces of Duarte, Santo Domingo, San José de Ocoa, Barahona, Bahoruco, San Juan de la Maguana, Sánchez Ramírez, Peravia, Azua, Distrito Nacional and San Cristóbal. Some 34 people died, 37,000 were displaced and approximately 7,412 homes were severely damaged. Around 61 per cent of damaged homes were in the province of Duarte, while 13 per cent were in Distrito Nacional and the Santo Domingo province. The agricultural sector also faced significant losses, with extensive damage to crops, greenhouses, and livestock, affecting over 7,000 producers in various provinces. President Luis Abinader estimated the damages to exceed US$460 million (excluding the Ministry of Public Works and Communications' budget). In the aftermath of the rains, ongoing health crises have continued to escalate. There has been an alarming surge of dengue, with 17,360 suspected cases, including 128 severe cases and 19 deaths this year. Additionally, a confirmed cholera outbreak in Barahona, heavily impacted by the floods, reported 29 cases, contributing to the overall national count of 1,109 suspected cases, 115 confirmed cases, and one death. The widespread impact of the event highlights the vulnerabilities of the country and the need to strengthen capacities to prevent, prepare and respond effectively. On 21 December 2023, the Emergency Operation Center of Dominican Republic (COE per its acronym in Spanish) published information about the heavy rains in the country. A total of 4 provinces are in yellow alert due to the flooding (3 decrease since the 20 December report). The heavy rains have affected 36 water distribution services and 400,133 people are without potable water (93,847 increase).\",\n",

In the last 30 hours, 97mm of rain fell in the affected areas. Flash floods triggered by the heavy rain have reportedly killed 20 people, including a number of children, when their homes collapsed or the vehicles they were traveling in were swept away. At least 10 people, including children, are still missing in Arghandab, Daman, Spin Boldak and Dand Districts. It is anticipated that up to 2,000 homes may have been damaged across all affected districts including Kandahar City. As of 3 March, heavy rains have caused flooding in six provinces, Kandahar, Kunar, Zabul, Nimroz, Hirat and Farah. In Kandahar, more than 1,000 people stranded by the flood waters have been rescued by ANSF. Reports suggest that 85 per cent of Farah city has been flooded. As of 4 March, eight provinces have been affected by heavy rains and flooding, according Government reports. More than 20 people are reported to have died as a result of the floods, including 13 people in Kandahar province. In excess of 1,600 houses have reportedly been damaged or destroyed, and there has been further damage water systems, agricultural land, schools, mosques and Government buildings. As of 5 March, nine provinces have been affected by heavy rains and flooding, according Government reports. More than 40 people are known to have died, and hundreds of others have been injured or are missing. According to the Government, more than 2,500 houses have been damaged and over 1,300 destroyed.

As of 10 March, 33,000 people in Kandahar province have been identified as requiring humanitarian assistance following floods that struck the province at the beginning of March. According to assessments conducted by the Government and humanitarian partners, 2,800 houses have been damaged and 1,850 houses destroyed. Assessments are still ongoing in affected areas that are difficult to access due to insecurity. Humanitarian partners have so far provided 673 flood-affected households with tents, NFIs including winter clothes, food assistance and hygiene kits. The Government has reportedly allocated 126 million Afghanis (US$1.7m) for assistance including shelter repairs, agricultural assistance and food. Since 2 March, there has also been extensive flooding in Hilmand, Herat and Farah provinces, and humanitarian partners are continuing to conduct assessments and provide assistance in these areas. Heavy rainfall has being affecting central, southern and western Afghanistan over the past two weeks, triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The most affected provinces are Kandahar, Helmand, Farah, Herat and Badghis. According to ACAPS (Assessment Capacities Project), as of 13 March, the death toll stands at 70, more than 8,670 houses have been damaged and approximately 250,000 people have been affected. Infrastructure damage, rugged terrain and the ongoing rainfall are hindering the response. Insecurity throughout the country remains high and may restrict operations. Nevertheless, the humanitarian response is being put in place to assist those affected with emergency shelter, food, non-food items, winter clothes and emergency latrines. Over the next 72 hours, locally heavy rain and snowfall are forecast over Kabul area and north-eastern areas of the country. Moderate rainfall and snowfall are forecast over the central areas of the country. As of 19 March, more than 122,600 people across 14 provinces have been identified as being affected by the March floods and in need of humanitarian assistance. As a result of the floods, 63 people are known to have died and a further 31 people have been injured. The highest number of affected people are in Farah, where almost 52,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance. A further 32,750 people in Kandahar and 18,340 people in Hilmand also require assistance. Heavy rains caused flash flooding on 27, 28 and 29 March in six provinces - Faryab, Balkh, Jawzjan, and Sar-e-Pul province in the Northern Region, and Hirat and Badghis in the Western Region. An estimated 17,000 people have been affected with Balkh and Hirat suffering the worst impacts. In Balkh, unconfirmed reports suggest several fatalities in Chemtal district, with up to 645 families (4,515 people) affected throughout the Province. In Hirat, Ministry of Health has reported that eight people died and nine were injured in six districts following flash flooding, while more than 1,000 families may have been affected. This new flooding adds to the impact of the overall flood emergency, with Farah and Kandahar the most effected to date. Since the beginning of 2019, more than 163,000 people have now been affected by floods, including those in the past week. A total of more than 42,000 people have been displaced. After heavy rainfall that affected 22 out of the 34 Provinces of Afghanistan over the past few days, the death toll has risen to at least 16. According to media, as of 18 April at 8.00 UTC, in eastern Nangarhar Province, 11 people have died, six are injured and 266 houses were washed away, while in the western Province of Herat the death toll stands at five. Unseasonal heavy rains and floods affected a number of regions of Afghanistan as well as Kabul, between 13 and 19 April. As of 22 April, 1,700 people have been affected with 16 people killed, 112 injured, and 250 houses damaged or destroyed due to flash floods. The floods have also damaged crops and infrastructure, including roads. Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) teams carried out rapid needs assessments of flood-affected areas on 1-9 March, and 10-14 April which showed mass destruction of houses and shelters, loss of lives, public facilities, mosques and displacements of people from their homes and IDPs camps due to the floods. It is anticipated that more rains shall fall in the coming months with little resources on the ground to respond to the needs of people in different provinces. The resilience of people in most of the provinces is already weak because of earlier protracted drought. There is a huge need in emergency shelter on the ground. Besides, there is continuous population movement from the rural villages to safer places with available humanitarian assistance and better basic services. Heavy rainfall in recent days has triggered flash floods in a number of areas with Kabul, Parwan, Ghour, Herat, Bamyan and Ghazni most affected. According to media reports, as of 27 May at 8.00 UTC, 24 people have died, 11 are injured and 550 affected. 220 houses have been destroyed and 116 partially damaged. Over the past 24 hours, light to moderate rain is forecast in the northern part of the country. Heavy rain affected several parts of Afghanistan over the past week, causing flash floods and triggering landslides. According to media reports, as of 11 June at 8.00 UTC, three people died and several houses have been destroyed after flash floods in Afghanistan.',\n",

According to Tunisia’s National Institute of Meteorology, the centre of the country and central-west regions including Siliana, Kairouan, Gafsa, Sidi Bouzid, Jendouba, Beja, El Kef, and Kasserine, recorded 60 mm and 80 mm of rain over four days, to locally reach an accumulative level 120 mm of rain. The country’s Civil Protection announced the death of an elderly woman in the governorate of Siliana and a second person is missing in the governorate of Kairouan. TRC teams reported three destroyed houses in Kairouan and two in Siliana as an impact of the heavy rain. Consequently, floodwater surged through many different districts, damaging infrastructure, houses, properties, and livelihoods in the affected areas. Moreover, crops and fruit trees were damaged by the heavy rain, and electricity has been cut off in some districts. Based on the TRC rapid assessments conducted in coordination with the local authorities, more than 4,000 people have been affected by the floods. Some of them fled their homes seeking shelter in neighbouring high-ground houses and villages, while others opted to stay in their damaged houses and move to rooftops rather than risk crossing flooded areas to reach evacuation points. Water supply through pipelines is limited, and some of the water available in some areas is contaminated.',\n",

The national meteorological agency estimates that Sarika will make landfall in the Aurora Quezon area as an equivalent of Category 2 cyclone early Sunday, 16 October. Typhoon Sarika made landfall in the Philippines in Aurora province, eastern Luzon on 15 October, as a strong Typhoon. It crossed Luzon swiftly, passing through the provinces of Aurora, Nueva Vizcava, Nueva Ecija and Pangasinan, losing strength but remaining a typhoon. The National Disaster Management Agency in the morning of 17 October (UTC) reported no casualties, about 200 houses damaged, minor landslides and power cuts. Around 40,000 people were preemptively evacuated and about 25,000 of them were still in shelters as of same date. Typhoon Sarika emerged over the South China Sea a few hours after landfall in the Philippines and moved W-NW in the general direction of Hainan province of China. As of 03 November, the official partial estimates of damage caused by both typhoons Sarika and Haima, which hit northern Luzon on 19 October, included 248,872 tonnes of lost crops. Large numbers of people are still living in temporary shelters and relying on humanitarian support. Most of the population affected by the typhoons are critically dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods and many are vulnerable to food insecurity. As of 04 November, preliminary official estimates indicated that about 400,000 hectares of paddy, maize and high value crops (such as mango, banana, papaya, cassava and vegetables) were adversely affected by both typhoons Haima and Sarika. The overall damage to the agriculture sector was estimated to be close to USD 234 million. However, the overall impact on 2016 cereal crops is expected to be limited. On 18 October, Typhoon Sarika made landfall on China's southern island of Hainan as a Category 2 typhoon with torrential rain and winds of up to 162 km/h. Nearly 500,000 people were evacuated from coastal and low-lying areas. As of 19 October in Hainan province, more than 500 houses collapsed and more than 2,000 were damaged, according to China's Ministry of Civil Affairs. Severe flooding triggered by heavy rainfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam has forced thousands of families to evacuate to safer grounds and left many other residents stranded without food or safe drinking water in their homes. According to local authorities, at least 21 people have died, 18 were injured, and 8 others are still missing after the floods inundated more than 27,000 houses and damaged 770 homes in the provinces of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Binh, which was the most impacted. Around 1,600 hectares of rice fields have been damaged and some families lost their livestock in the floods.\",\n",

According to the IFRC, people in affected areas have inadequate access to basic hygiene and limited access to safe water and nutritional food, potentially exposing them to health risks. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reports that Typhoon Sarika affected a total of 70,169 families, or 300,396 people, in six regions: I, II, III, CALABARZON, V and CAR. On 20 December, the European Commission announced the release of €328,000 in humanitarian aid funding to channel emergency relief to communities affected by typhoons Sarika and Haima. The aid will focus on providing assistance to meet the most pressing needs of 17,000 people in some of the worst hit provinces: Aurora, Cagayan, Catanduanes, Kalinga and Nueva Vizcaya.',\n",

In addition, the devaluation and depreciation of the local currency in May 2012 significantly lowered consumer purchasing power as prices of basic commodities and staple food continued to rise. The Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC) conducted an assessment in Oct 2012 and projected that the number of vulnerable population had increased from 1.63 million to 1.97 million people, representing a 21% increase. An initial Food Insecurity Response Plan with an estimated budget of $48 million was presented by the Government of Malawi with the support of the humanitarian partners in Aug 2012. For the 2013/14 consumption period, the MVAC's National Food Security Forecast projected that 1.4 million people in the 21 districts would be food insecure, representing 9.5 per cent of the population, with the Northern region being the worst affected. In December 2014, delayed rains had negative impacts on crop production. The delay prolonged the lean period for households and reduced agriculture labor opportunities, adversely impacting incomes among households that were dependent on markets for food purchases. Approximately 640,000 people were identified as food insecure countrywide. An estimated 640,009 persons were assessed to be food insecure in 19 districts by the 2014 Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC), a sharp decrease compared with the 1.46 million people estimated in the previous year. The lower number reflected improved food availability and access in 2014, following the larger maize harvest and sharply reduced prices.\",\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'The rainy season of 2017 has begun in many regions of the country and to date -CONRED-, has responded to 142 incidents that have directly and indirectly affected 144,415 people nationwide. In 20 departments of the country, actions have been taken to care for those affected - only Santa Rosa and Chimaltenango have reported no major incidents. The departments where incidents have been recorded for the rainy season are Guatemala with 18 incidents; Quiché with 17 incidents; as well as 10 incidents in San Marcos, 10 in Huehuetenango and another 10 in the department of Jutiapa. The incidents which have occurred were floods, landslides and landslides. The rainy season will not end until November, and so far 144,415 people have been affected. There have been 1,470 evacuees, 938 victims, 667 people have been sheltered, and 16 people have reportedly died in the current rainy season 2017. Between 2-3 September, floods were reported in the departments of Alta Verapaz, Petén and Suchitepéquez, with 2,466 people affected and damage in 438 homes, according to damage assessments and needs analysis carried out by institutions of the National Coordinating System for Disaster Reduction. According to the Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology National Institute (INSIVUMEH), heavy rainfall on 18 September of 2017, caused floodings throughout Guatemala, particularly in the north-western region of the country. Floods were registered in the municipalities of San Felipe, Santa Cruz Muluá, San Martín Zapotitlán, Mazatenango’s urban centre, Colotenango’s urban centre, Calle de la Cruz, Callejón 10, Campo Borrayo, and the cantons of Icán, La otra banda and Tulula, among other areas. When the Guatemalan Red Cross Damage Analysis and Needs Assessment (DANA) teams were deployed to the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez, the departmental delegate from CONRED reported that the flooding affected 629 people, forced 164 people to evacuate from their homes and 97 people to seek shelter in collective centres, damaged 68 roads and impacted 1 bridge in the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez. In the departments of Suchitepéquez and Retalhuleu, floods have damaged homes, crops and household goods. Around 2,016 families are affected according to local authorities. The flood-stricken families preferred to find their own shelter since the collective centres assigned by local authorities do not have electricity, running water, toilets, showers or kitchens, and are far away from people’s homes; the loss of bedding, clothing, blankets and the necessary tools for their livelihoods, among other items has also prompted affected people to seek their own shelter to safeguard the few belongings they still have left. Local authorities have declared an orange level for the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez to be able to provide emergency assistance to the affected areas, and on September 27 2017, CONRED declared Red Alert in Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez, to provide assistance to the local emergencies. Continuous rains have fallen in the department of Alta Verapaz for the entire month of October 2017, affecting 62 rural and urban communities in 8 municipalities due to increased water levels and the overflow of the Cahabón, Chixoy, Icbolay and Polochic Rivers. The heavy rains that continue to pound the area are compounded by the presence of an easterly wave, the arrival of Tropical Storm Selma, increased humidity saturation levels and swollen rivers that threaten to impact further already flooded areas. As of 31 October 2017, 13 collective centres have been opened to house more than 999 people, whose homes were directly affected. Alta Verapaz is one of the largest maize producers in Guatemala, accounting for 10 per cent of the total production in the country; however, crops are being lost to the flooding, which puts small and medium-sized farmers’ food security at risk for the next few months, according to information provided by the Guatemalan Red Cross (GRC) branch in Cobán. Per official reports, 450 hectares owned by 1,097 families have been affected in the municipality of Chisec, Raxruhá and Panzós. On 7 December, following the floods caused by Guatemala’s exceptionally strong rain season, the European Commission is providing €90 000 in humanitarian aid to assist 3500 people in the central Alta Verapaz department.',\n",

As per the Civil Defense Directorate spokesperson, heavy rains caused water inundation across the city, leading to transportation disruptions, and raising concerns about potential floodings, as forecasted by the regional meteorology department. In addition, the mudslides rush down to the roads and Duhok city suffers severe floods. This is caused by the receiving of 80 mm rainwater on Thursday in many districts across the KRI, and more rains are forecasted in the country. Current torrential rains and flooding also caused damage to pavements and road infrastructure. According to the authorities, 16 villages are affected by the floods and have been cut off from the main city due to the blockage of roads. Government authorities are responding and evacuating residents in areas prone to landslides and flash floodings. Heavy floods have also been reported in Erbil city. The provinces of Diyala, Wassit and Maysan, due to their proximity to neighbouring Iran, also witnessed flooding in the past. The current rain spell resulted in small scale losses due to the flow of floods in the outskirts of Diyala governorate, Baldrouz and Al-Muqdadiyah provinces, where two families are affected. In Maysan, the torrential rains continue and floods flow in the outskirts of the province in rural areas. Based on the initial assessment as reported by the Iraqi Red Crescent Society, an estimated number of 921 households were affected in Dohuk and Erbil governorates. Heavy rainfall affected eastern Iraq, in particular the Diyala and the Maysan governorates, on 1-2 May, causing floods and flash floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. As of 5 May, according to Iraqi Red Crescent (IFRC), at least 600 people have been affected by floods, of whom 516 people in Kishkool and Al-Salam regions in Diyala governorate, and 84 people in Maysan governorate.

According to UN OCHA, as of 29 July, 8,700 people have been affected in the aforementioned town. Regional authorities are coordinating the response for those affected by the floods. Hydro-climatic forecasts for the 2024 rainy season indicate a high risk of flooding in several regions of Mali, particularly in the basins of the Niger and Senegal rivers. Mali is already experiencing the effects of these floods. In some areas, dams have been opened due to rising water levels. According to these meteorological data, the likelihood of heavy rainfall will continue over the coming weeks, indicating a significant risk of flooding. Alerts received from ACMAD and technical agencies in Mali demonstrate a strong probability of flooding in various regions, with a peak expected in August, which is typically the rainiest month. The risk is particularly acute in areas prone to severe flooding, such as the Inner Niger Delta and the basins of the Bani and Senegal rivers, including Mopti, Sikasso, and Segou, which are currently on alert following forecasts of heavy rains since the end of July. In addition to the opened dams in the country to release excess water flow, heavy rainfall has been recorded in Bla (Ségou) since July 22, 2024, leading to flooding in the districts of Flawèrè, Bakaribougou, Nouméa, and Bléla. These floods have damaged homes, latrines, and wells, resulting in material losses and impacts on livelihoods. The flooding has caused considerable damage to local infrastructure: 380 homes have collapsed, 165 latrines have been destroyed, and 128 wells have been damaged. Significant losses of food and livestock reserves have also been reported. The Government of Mali has declared a national disaster following floods that have claimed 30 lives and affected 47,374 people since the start of the rainy season. As of 9 September, the floods have worsened considerably in all 19 of Mali’s regions. The regions of Ségou (39,245), Timbuktu (36,317), Gao (19,238), Bamako (17,127), and Mopti (1,782) have recorded the highest number of people affected.

More than 40,000 people have been affected so far. Heavy rainfall has been affecting southern South Africa (in particular the Eastern Cape Province) over the last 24 hours, causing floods and river overflow (particularly the Komani River) that have resulted in evacuations and damage. Media report, as of 9 February, around 1,000 evacuated people, some flooded hospitals and a number of affected bridges and closed roads across the Komani Town area (formerly Queenstown, central Eastern Cape Province). Second wave of heavy rainfall were recorded on February. The level of flooding incidence led on 13th of February 2023, to the government to declared a National State of Disaster to enable an intensive, coordinated response to the impact of floods that are affecting Mpumalanga, the Eastern Cape, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, the Northern Cape and North West provinces. Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape provinces had been receiving rains as early as the 8th of February and were identified as the hardest hit out of the 7 provinces. Impacts of the floods included over 48 fatalities reported, 12 people reported missing, 1,568 people (the bulk being in Eastern Cape with 1,259 people) have been displaced, and are now accommodated in 12 evacuation centers (inclusive of the 1 under the 11th December floods).

The ASEAN Disaster Information Network (ADINet) reports, as of 12 July, 605 evacuated people across three evacuation centres, around 22,550 affected people and three damaged bridges in the Region, in particular across the Davao City area. A flash flood occurred in Cagayan De Oro City on 13 July, reportedly caused by flood water from the nearby province of Bukidnon. According to the Department of Social Welfare and Development, the flash flood affected around 910 families, damaging a number or shelters. Barangays Tablon and Cugma are most affected, with around 400 households submerged in flood in Barangay Tablon and 128 households in Barangay Cugma. Large parts of the Luzon island in the north of the Philippines, including Metropolitan Manila, have been experiencing heavy monsoon rain in the last days. On 24 July, the water level of the Marikina River in Manila reached 16 meter, triggering evacuations. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reports that around 14,000 individuals have been pre-emptively evacuated. Most of the affected communities are located in Marikina City and in the nearby towns of San Mateo, Taytay, and Cainta in the province of Rizal. In Occidental Mindoro, 185 families in the municipalities of Sablayan, St. Cruz and Mamburao had to evacuate to six evacuation centers. Tropical Cyclone IN-FA (local name: FABIAN) has reportedly exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) as of 24 Jul. The Southwest Monsoon brought moderate to heavy with at times intense rains in multiple regions of the Philippines according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC). Southwest Monsoon-related incidents were reported for Regions 1, 2. 3, 6, CALABARZON, MIMAROPA, CAR, and NCR, resulted in 1 death and 2 injuries. It has also affected 480 barangays, 50,676 families (202,213 persons), and displaced 72,239 people (38,472 in 365 evacuation centres). Heavy monsoon rains over the past five days, fuelled by moisture brought by Typhoon In-fa (local name Fabian), caused flooding and landslides in several areas of Luzon island and prompted the evacuation of residents in low-lying communities. Floodwater up to 5 feet high reportedly inundated more than 170 villages mostly in Central Luzon and the National Capital Region. As of 25 July, at least 80,000 people are displaced of which 30,600 people are hosted in 291 evacuation centres while 49,500 people are staying in home-based settings. At least three people died, five people were injured, and 450 houses were damaged, according to authorities. Widespread floods caused by Southwest Monsoon rains continue to affect The Philippines, resulting in casualties. According to the Disaster Response Operations Monitoring and Information Centre (DSWD-DROMIC), more than 570,240 people are affected and 42,111 of these are displaced. Floods have damaged at least 293 houses, with 69 destroyed. Heavy rainfall hit several parts of the Philippines from 28 July–1 August, triggering landslides and floods. Ilocos, Central Luzon, Eastern Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Mimaropa, Cordillera Administrative Region and National Capital Region are most affected.

This calamity had widespread effects, impacting both urban and rural areas in Gurjaani and Lentekhi Municiplaities – Kakheti and Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti regions, respectively. The heavy rainfall led to the flooding of the central streets in Gurjaani municipality, including the surrounding areas of the central agricultural market, resulting in severe difficulties in transportation and mobility. Additionally, sudden mudflows and landslides caused the destruction of roads, blockages from fallen trees, and damage to vital infrastructure like bridges and power transmission towers. Specifically, the flooding affected several areas in Gurjaani municipality, including Gurjaani, Chumlaki, Tchandari, Vejini, Dzirkoki, Kolagi, Bakurtsikhe, and Kodalo. In Lentekhi, which is one of the highest mountainous populated areas in Georgia, the storms affected Chikhareshi, Jakhunderi, Nakisheri, Skhedi, Upper Shkedi, Akhalsheni, Panaga, and Lekosadeni villages. State infrastructure such as bridges, in-land roads, and power transmission towers were also damaged. Although Georgia is prone to flooding and hailstorms, it is worth noting that these kinds of floods are not common in either of these municipalities, as none of them are located in high-risk flash flood zones. It is the first time in recent decades that Gurjaani municipality faced such a disaster. Consequently, the population was not prepared for potential effects of this sudden disaster in the region.

Among these households, the homes of 112 households were completely destroyed; these households now reside with other members of the community who were not affected by the floods. The homes of the remaining affected households (272 households) were partially damaged. At the time of data collection, these households continued to reside in these homes. Following heavy rains, and the subsequent rise in the Bahr Azoum River's water level on the night of 30 July 2022, a total of 975 households (4,830 individuals) were affected by floods in two localities located in the sous-préfecture of Koukou Andarana (département of Koukou Andarana, province of Sila). Among these households, the homes of 390 households (1,905 individuals), residing in the locality of Koukou centre, were completely destroyed and they took refuge on a hill located in the locality considering that given its height, it would not be affected by probable flooding in coming weeks. The houses of 585 other households (2,925 individuals), residing in the locality of Habilé, were partially damaged. On Friday 5 August, several neighbourhoods were flooded after heavy rains hit in the capital city of Chad, Ndjamena. According to OCHA, the rains keep affecting various regions of the country, including the province of Logone Oriental, causing human and material damage, and loss of livelihoods to a significant part of the population. The rapid assessment conducted by Red Cross of Chad (RCC) teams between 5 and 10 August 2022 identified at least 20,657 people affected, and the number continues to rise. Material damage is estimated at 2,067 houses completely destroyed. During the week of 01 to 7 August 2022, the successive heavy rainfall in N'Djamena, combined with the low-lying position of the Gozator hospital and the lack of drainage in its vicinity caused the main basin behind it to overflow and led to an unprecedented flooding of the hospital. According to the latest report of UN OCHA, almost 623,000 people have been affected across 16 of the 23 Provinces, including the Capital N’Djamena with 44,839 affected people. The worst-hit Provinces are Tandjilé (southern Chad) with 166,258 affected people, followed by Logone (147,129 people), Mandoul (82,608), and Sila (77,357). In the capital, N’Djamena, a quarter of the city is flooded, and the humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly as over 50,000 people were displaced in the span of just days. This figure may double in the next week, as waters of the Logone and Chari rivers from the south continue to flood the capital on their way to Lake Chad. Since September 8, heavy rains battered the south of the country, causing the Chari and Logone rivers (which meet in the capital city of N'Djamena) to overflow their banks and forcing 181,720 people (28,907 households) to flee their homes and take refuge in public spaces. The flooding is a result of heavy rainfall across the country, overflowing of rivers and/or the breaching of dikes. As of January 20, 2023, the most affected provinces are Lac with 250,091 victims, Mayo Kebbi Est with 228,708 victims, Mayo Kebi Ouest (50,022 victims), Logone Occidental (147,129 victims), Logone Oriental (10,052 victims), Tandjilé (138,831 victims), Mandoul (82,608 victims), Salamat (19,080 victims), Sila (92,600 victims), Guéra (65,047 victims), and Batha (26,466 victims).

In Aden, torrential rains flooded houses and roads in Crater and Al Mualla districts. In Hadramaut, houses, road bridges, water networks, and crops were destroyed and livestock drowned in Al Sawm, Hajr, Mayfa and Brom districts. Sites for internally displaced people (IDPs) were worst affected where rains destroyed shelters and property and led to stagnant water. Initial findings suggest that at least 4,625 families have been affected in 60 IDP sites. An estimated 21,240 families (148,680 people) have been affected by flooding in 13 governorates since mid-April. Conditions are hardest for thousands of families already displaced who have lost shelter, food rations and household supplies. In Marib Governorate, torrential rains affected 6,286 families including 7 fatalities while 250 people were injured. The rains also caused houses to collapse, and damaged infrastructure making some roads impassable in Raymah Governorate and Marib City and surrounding areas. In Sana’a and northern governorates, at least 9,146 families were affected, with Sana’a City and most parts of Sana’a governorate particularly badly hit by flooding. Over 5,130 families have been affected in Hajjah Governorate alone, and partners have reported severe damage to shelters at sites for internally displaced persons (IDPs) as a result urgent needs for WASH interventions and food assistance are required. An estimated 4,764 households have been affected in IDP sites in southern governorates, including 1,812 families in Aden, 1,037 in Abyan, 917 in Taizz and 770 in Lahj governorates. In Aden City, the worst affected areas are Crater and Mualla. During the month of April, Yemen has experienced heavy rains which caused flash floods in different governorates of the country requiring immediate assistance. On 21 April, a tropical storm hit the southern coast of Yemen with highest impact in Lahj, Aden, Taiz, Ad Dali’, Abyan and Hadramawt. According to preliminary assessments, at least 150,000 people were affected across 13 governorates, including 64,000 internally displaced people. The health authorities in Aden reported on 22 April the deaths of seven people, including four children, while two people were missing. In Crater District, a family of four were reported to have died when their house collapsed, and in Mualla District, three people died and another 27 were injured. In Aden City, local authorities reported that 66 houses were damaged or destroyed. There is widespread damage to private and public property, including many vehicles and food stocks, and some basic services have been cut. The Ministry of Electricity reported a total power outage in Aden City; there was a possibility that power might be restored to some districts within 48 hours, while pumped drinking water was being restored after it stopped for 24 hours. At sites, for internally displaced people (IDPs) across southern governorates, initial assessments indicated that at least 5,537 displaced families were affected by the rains in 69 locations. In Mualla District in Aden, 100 families from the local community have been displaced by the floods besides flooding to two schools. Heavy rain has been affecting several Governorates of the country (in particular Hadhramaut, Shabwa and Al Mahrah) since the last few days, causing widespread floods and resulting in casualties and damage. According to media reports, 16 people died in eastern Hadhramaut and central Shabwa. Around 130 people have been displaced, 25 houses flooded and hundreds of livestock have been killed by flood events in Hadhramaut. The authorities deployed emergency teams to rescue people trapped in valleys by the floodings. Since the past week, heavy rain has been affecting western Yemen (particularly Al-Hodeidah, Ibb, Hajjah, Lahj, Shabwah, Abyan, and Sana'a Governorates), triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. Media reports, as of 28 July, 17 fatalities (of which 13 across Al-Hodeidah, 3 in Hajjah and one across Ibb). In addition, more than 50 houses were destroyed across the aforementioned Governorates. Over the next 24 hours, more heavy rain is forecast over western and central Governorates, with locally very heavy rain over the already affected ones.\",\n",

Brian passed just south of the city after midnight and soon entered open waters again. It then changed its track west-northwestwards and weakened to a severe tropical storm. Brian made landfall over the northern part of Viet Nam about 230km south of Hanoi on the afternoon of 3 October and weakened rapidly to a tropical storm. As it moved further inland, it further weakened to an area of low pressure in Laos. Brian caused severe flooding in Hainan. About 96,000 hectares of paddy rice were inundated. Forty people were killed and 529 were injured. About 15,900 houses collapsed and 169,000 were damaged. Over 25 million lumber trees and rubber trees were blown down. There were about 1,300 reports of damage of dams and hydro-electric stations and 63 damage reports of bridges. Other damage included 134 boats, 700km of power cables and 2,100 km of telephone lines. The total damage was estimated to be about 837 million RMB. Off the coast of Hainan, a Hong Kong fishing vessel sank on the morning of 3 October. The area was searched but none of the seven crew members was found. Typhoon Angela swept across the northern coast of Luzon during the early hours of 6 October. The flooding caused by Typhoon Angela left at least 118 people dead and 27 injured in northern Philippines. About 1,400 houses were destroyed, 3,300 houses were damaged, and 9,000 people were left homeless. The strong winds also toppled electric and telephone posts. Rice fields and tobacco land were inundated. Crops damaged were estimated to be about 1.6 million pesos. Angela entered the South China Sea on 6 October and weakened considerably after interacting with the terrain of northern Luzon. It continued its westward track across the northern part of the South China Sea at about 13 km/h. It weakened to a severe tropical storm on 10 October and made landfall over Viet Nam about 210 km northwest of Danang. Angela soon dissipated over land. Initial assessment of the damage in Viet Nam was as follows: 52 dead, 762 injured and 52 missing. At least 90,000 houses collapsed or were destroyed. Typhoon Dan swept across the central Philippines during the night of 10 October, and passed just south of Manila the following morning. According to press reports, 57 people were injured and 80 killed in the Philippines during the passage of Dan. Strong winds toppled trees and power pylons in Manila where power supply was cut off for more than 24 hours. The losses from damage to crops and property as well as industrial disruption ran to millions of US dollars. Dan passed about 80 km south-southwest of Yaxian, Hainan early on 13 October. In Hainan, the city of Tongshi was severely flooded with water levels rising to 1.5 metres high. In Lingshui and Yaxian Counties, flooding occurred in several villages and caused some houses to collapse, leaving hundreds of people homeless. Two people were killed and 21 were injured. Damage to agriculture, power supply and communication was severe. The casualties due to Brian, Angela and Dan were reported to be 63 killed, 15 missing and 712 injured. About 30 million rubber trees were blown down. The total loss due to the three typhoons was estimated to be over 1,000 million RMB. Dan weakened to a severe tropical storm on 13 October as it moved towards the Viet Nam coast. It made landfall about 300km south of Hanoi that evening. Dan finally dissipated in Laos about 180 km east-northeast of Vientiane early on 14 October. In Viet Nam, 34 people were killed and 466 were injured. Floods caused by heavy rain swept away some 8,000 houses and several hundred boats. About 134,000 hectares of rice ready for harvest were inundated. Dan's powerful winds also blew down about 44,000 houses and tore off the roofs of another 500,000 houses. Traffic on the trans-Viet Namese highway was also blocked.\",\n",

The NDMA has called for international support, with a USD 10 million requirement for emergency relief. With the rainy season far from over, an estimated 100,000 people remain at risk of flooding, storms, and coastal erosion, with heightened health risks anticipated. A joint assessment conducted by the NDMA, local community structures, and the Liberian Red Cross Community-Based Action Teams (CBATs) reported that 47 communities in Monrovia have experienced flooding over the last three days. Cape Mount and Bong counties reported 28 affected communities and villages. The Liberia Meteorological Department has predicted continuous rains between May and September 2024 across six counties: Montserrado, Bomi, Cape Mount, Margibi, Grand Bassa, and Maryland (coastal). The affected populations have lost valuable household items and are exposed to risks of disease outbreaks, loss of habitat (sheltering opportunities), livelihood mechanisms, and water source pollution. About 68% of the affected people are women, children, and other vulnerable groups, including the physically challenged and single mothers, who are seeking shelter in temporary facilities (public and private buildings) and with neighbours and relatives in adjacent unflooded communities.',\n",

       "   'disaster_description': \"Severe drought conditions during southern Madagascar’s rainy season from November 2017 to April 2018 have led to nearly dry dams in many parts of the south. This dryness has affected livestock’s access to water and pastureland, which has led to poor livestock body conditions as many are subsisting on burnt cactus leaves in the absence of viable pastureland. This has similarly affected crop development, with many areas experiencing failed or near failed harvests. Only Ambovombe commune received favorably heavy rains in July that allowed some farmers to plant new maize and potato crops. Poor and very poor households in MG23 (the Mahafaly plains) in the southwest of Madagascar are experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity because of poor or failed agricultural production and the resulting early dependence on markets for food. In Androy Semi-Arid Cassava, Maize and Livestock (MG 24), food security is deteriorating following the harvest period as stocks deplete and poor and very poor households are currently in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) with the exception of Ambovombe where the situation is better. Food insecurity is less severe in the Southeast (MG 19) and Rice and lima bean (MG 20) which remain in Stressed (IPC Phase 2). The rest of the country remains in Minimal (IPC Phase 1). According to Crop and Food Security Assessment (CFSAM) of August 2018, rainfall deficits and fall armyworm attacks have had significant impact on food production levels (particularly staple crops such as maize and cassava), compromising access to food for the majority of households. Southern Madagascar is in the grip of a humanitarian catastrophe, with 1.5 million people—half the region’s population—needing immediate emergency food assistance, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) warned today. Three straight years of drought have wiped out harvests and hampered people's access to food and COVID-19 is compounding their suffering. Those experiencing “crisis” or “emergency” hunger conditions—three times the number forecast mid-year—are mostly children and women. Of the ten hardest-hit southern districts, Amboasary is the epicenter; families barely scrape together enough food with raw mangoes and tamarind often their only food source. Mothers can no longer breastfeed and are forced to give their infants water which is in scarce supply. A WFP assessment in Amboasary last month found three out of four children had quit school - mostly to help their parents forage for food.\",\n",
       "   'interventions': 'In coordination with the Government of Madagascar and in collaboration with the humanitarian community, WFP’s response plan will focus on providing food and nutritional assistance to the populations that are classified in IPC crisis and in emergency phases from September-December 2018. Out of 1.3 million people who are classified in IPC crisis (3) and emergency (4) phases, WFP aims to provide food assistance and nutritional support to 849,000 people using a combination of food and cash-based modalities. It is expected that other actors in the food security sector (government and NGOs) will provide assistance to 35% of the population in IPC 3 and 4 phases. A second response phase to support drought-affected communities through early recovery interventions is planned for the January-March 2019 period. During both response phases, WFP will work closely with FAO and other food security and livelihoods cluster members to ensure that the assistance provided is complementary. Humanitarian actors are currently delivering assistance to approximately 415,463 beneficiaries across the Grand South, with the highest levels of assistance in Ampanihy and Betoiky. 154,078 beneficiaries are receiving 100,000 MGA per month in cash transfers, and 261,385 beneficiaries are receiving 30 kg of rice, 5 kg of legumes, and 3 kg of cooking oil per month. Both types of assistance represent 50 percent of kilocalorie needs, and are covering at least a portion of household’s food gaps, thus preventing worse outcomes in areas where assistance is highest.',\n",

       "   'disaster_description': \"A deep depression over the Bay of Bengal intensified into Cyclonic storm “Remal” and it is expected to make landfall near West Bengal and Bangladesh coasts around midnight between 26 and 27 May. Wind speed ranging 90-120 kmph (with a maximum up to 135) and a surge height ranging 3-4 m are expected in the coastal areas of Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Hatia, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barisal, Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Feni, Cumilla, Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. There is a particular alert for Rohingya camps and hill districts for heavy rainfall and subsequent landslide risks. The overall potential exposed population is 1.9 million, who may be displaced during the cyclone, with almost 0.5 million houses estimated to be possibly damaged or destroyed. The cyclone made landfall over the border area between India, West Bengal state and Bangladesh, Khulna division on 26 May around 18.00 UTC. Tidal surges as high as 12 feet, heavy rainfall, and wind speeds of up to 120 km/h have led to inundation of many southwestern coastal areas of Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, over 800,000 people have been evacuated to safer areas in 16 coastal districts ahead of the cyclone in 9,000 shelters. Tens of thousands of volunteers had been mobilized by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) to quicken the evacuation efforts and relief has already been transported to remote areas. 10,599 houses are so far reported fully destroyed, while 18,605 are reported partially destroyed, and 9 people are reported dead. Millions are without power. Over the next 48 hours, very heavy rainfall and strong winds are expected over West Bengal and most of Bangladesh. As of 28 May, ten casualties are reported across southern Bangladesh and six more in the West Bengal state (India). Around 800,000 are displaced across Bangladesh and 150,000 in India. Approximately 3.75 million of affected people in both countries. Around 115,000 houses were reported damaged in India and 35,000 destroyed in Bangladesh, fostering high risk of protracted displacement. Media report, as of 29 May, a total of 54 fatalities, of which 44 in India and 10 across Bangladesh. In India, 27 fatalities and seven missing people were reported across the Mizoram state, seven fatalities in West Bengal, four fatalities and 18 injured people in Assam, four fatalities in Nagaland and two fatalities and four injured people in Meghalaya. More than 37,000 damaged houses were reported across the affected states. In Bangladesh, around 807,000 people have been evacuated in nearly 9,500 shelters and around 70,285 houses have been completely destroyed, 107,176 of which partially damaged. The humanitarian impact is increasing after the passage of tropical storm REMAL which made landfall near the Bangladesh-India border and crossed north-eastern India on 26-28 May. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), as of 29 May, in Bangladesh 16 people died, 807,023 people have been evacuated to 9,424 evacuation centres and almost 3.5 million people have been affected. In addition, 40,246 houses were completely damaged, and 131,678 others were partially damaged. The rain and high tides damaged some embankments and flooded coastal areas in the Sundarbans. Rain brought by the cyclone, flooded roads also in the capital Dhaka. In India, media report at least 37 fatalities, most of them in Mizoram State, dozens missing people, and hundreds of evacuated. The worst affected states are Mizoram, West Bengal, Assam, and Meghalaya. Tropical storm REMAL struck northeastern India and Bangladesh from May 26-28, causing severe flooding and landslides. In India's northeast, 39 people were reported dead, with the highest fatalities in Mizoram. Dozens remain missing, over 500 were injured, and significant displacement has occurred, with nearly 21,000 affected and 175 homes damaged across Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Tripura. In Manipur, the storm impacted around 188,143 people and damaged over 24,000 houses. West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district saw 1.9 million people affected, thousands of homes damaged, and over 150,000 people evacuated to relief camps. Further assessments are pending. In Bangladesh, the cyclone's aftermath left 16 dead and affected 3.75 million people, according to Save the Children. Approximately 150,000 homes were hit, affecting 639,000 people, including many children. In India, 10 days after the cyclone Remal made a landfall, there has been random episodes of unseasonal rainfall in the affected area. As per media reports 07 people have lost their lives and nearly 100 people have been injured as a consequence of the cyclone. People continue to live in damaged and uninhabitable conditions with unusable toilet facility conditions. Some local donor agencies have supported with tarpaulin sheets which is providing temporary relief. There were more than 1,400 relief camps functional during the cyclone, now they have been closed and people have returned to their homes, many of which have been partially or completely destroyed. As per government reports from the district of South 24 Parganas, 23 blocks, 249 Gram Panchayats (village level government administration), 1,905,032 people are affected. Government has distributed 70,914 tarpaulins and 153,353 fresh cooked meals to the impacted people. In Bangladesh, according to the Department of Disaster Management (DDM), under the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), about 4.6 million people were affected by Cyclone Remal in 19 districts, and 16 people died across seven districts. Approximately 807,023 people were evacuated to 9,424 evacuation shelters across 19 districts. Over 173,000 houses were damaged, including 40,338 that were completely uninhabitable. About 80,591 hectares of cultivable land were inundated. Additionally, 50,000 fish enclosures, 34,000 ponds, and 4,000 crab farms were severely flooded, disrupting food supply chains, and exacerbating livelihoods and food insecurity. More than 530,000 farmers have been affected by damage to crops worth BDT 10,595 million (USD 90.7 million). Bangladesh has recently undergone civil unrest and turmoil, compounding the already existing humanitarian situation that resulted from the recent Cyclone Remal and the floods in the northeastern parts of the country. The situation has impacted the well-being and lives of millions of children, women, and the entire population. Response efforts are being hindered by disrupted logistics, communication breakdowns, and coordination issues, leading to delays in delivering water and essential supplies such water purification tablets, education in emergency kits (EIE kits) and dignity kits. Violence and unrest resulted in roadblocks and curfews, restricting access to affected areas and delaying the provision of emergency services. The safety of humanitarian workers is at risk, further limiting their ability to assist, while increased anxiety, fear and mental stress have reduced attendance at awareness sessions and impacted health services seeking by communities. By September 2024, a total of 18.4 million people in Bangladesh have been impacted by cyclone Remal and recurrent floods, leaving an estimated 6.4 million in need of immediate assistance in 29 districts, which accounts for 45 per cent of the 64 total districts. Six months after Cyclone Remal made landfall, the most vulnerable families in Bangladesh continue to struggle to recover from its impacts. In the worst-affected areas, many people are still living in damaged homes, unable to afford repairs. With the onset of winter between December and January, these families are likely to face additional hardships as they contend with cold weather. The cyclone caused significant losses in household income and livelihoods, compounded by a subsequent economic downturn. Damage to standing crops, essential tools, and equipment, along with saline water intrusion, has severely disrupted agricultural production. In some of the hardest-hit areas, access to hygiene, sanitation, and safe drinking water remains extremely limited.\",\n",

According to media, several houses have collapsed and other buildings were reported with structural damage. The epicentral area is not densely populated. As of 12:00 am, according to national media, the death toll has reached at least 820 and this figure is likely to increase over the day. Following the magnitude-6.8 earthquake that hit the Kingdom of Morocco’s High Atlas Mountain range on 8 September, a total of 2,122 people are reported to have lost their lives; the vast majority in Al-Haouz, the epicenter, and Taroudant provinces. Another 2,421 individuals are reported as injured. Initial assessments indicate that WASH, shelter, health, and food assistance are required. Several aftershocks have been reported, families still trapped under the rubble of their homes, road blockages and difficult geographic conditions remain challenging to conduct search and rescue interventions. Many residents sought refuge outdoors, fearing additional seismic activity and enduring unsettling aftershocks. After the 6.8 M earthquake of 8 September in Al Haouz Province, the number of casualties is increasing.

A preliminary investigation by the bureau reported 10 people missing, 2,400 displaced, and the livelihoods of 818,300 people affected. Torrential rains and landslides caused by Tropical Storm Kammuri killed at least 28 people in China's southwestern Yunnan province. The torrential rains triggered flash floods and landslides in the mountainous border province, destroying some 2,700 homes, damaging another 13,000 homes and causing an estimated US$80 million (549 million Yuan) in damages to agriculture. Flash floods caused by Typhoon Kammuri hit the northern part of Viet Nam on the night of 8 August, leaving 162 either dead or missing, and 81 injured. Flash floods affected eight mountainous provinces in the north, including Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Phu Tho, Tuyen Quang, Lai Chau, Son La, Ha Giang and Bac Kan. In Lao Cai, river water levels rose as high as 84.91 metres as result of flash floods compounded by torrential rains. The province was almost completely blocked off by water. Several roads, highways and railway were damaged and 213 houses totally destroyed. In the mountain village of Tung Chin I, Bat Xat, Lao Cai province, 19 out of 40 houses in the village have been swept away, leaving 21 people either dead or missing, with several dozen hectares of agricultural farmlands levelled after the night of 8 August. Around 3,000 houses in Phu Tho province were submerged in water while in Phuong Xa commune, Cam Khe district, half of the village was under water up to the roofs of houses due to breaches in the dyke. Tropical storm Kammuri lingered over northern Lao People's Democratic Republic for several days in August, causing the Mekong River to exceed historically high levels on 15 August, reportedly the worst in 100 years. The worst-affected areas were Luangphrabang, Luang Namtha, Bokeo, Khammuane, Vientiane and Borikhamxai provinces and Vientiane Capital. An estimated 204,189 people in some 866 villages from 53 districts across the country were affected. Flash floods were also reported, causing 11 deaths. Large areas of agricultural land were inundated and more than 70 per cent of the affected areas were damaged.\",\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'The Ministry of Health on 19 April declared an outbreak of Hepatitis E that has killed 25 among 86 infected people. Medical assistance and preventive measures are ongoing to curb the disease which is mostly transmitted through contaminated water. The current outbreak in Niger is closely linked to an unclean water supply and hygiene and sanitation facilities for the 240,000 people who are currently displaced in Diffa. This is a particularly vulnerable population that for years has been suffering the consequences of the conflict between Boko Haram and armies in the region. To contain the outbreak, MSF has been working with the Ministry of Health for several weeks. Additionally, MSF has significantly increased its water and sanitation activities in Kitchendi, Garin Wazan and Toumour villages, where around 135,000 people have settled—the vast majority of which are displaced. The organization also distributed water chlorination tablets, soap and new jerrycans for 16,800 families in these villages. So far, more than 27,900 gallons of water have been treated and jerrycans being used in the community have been cleaned to prevent the spread of the disease. There is a risk that the outbreak will intensify. New cases are expected to continue to emerge in new health districts in the region. Diffa region is prone to rapid propagation of the disease due to the prevalent underlying factors, such as limited access to safe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices. The region is inhabited by vulnerable populations, such as refugees, IDPs, and returnees who are at risk of contracting the disease due to their living conditions. The forthcoming rainy season, from June to September, is likely to increase the spread of the disease to neighbouring regions, and will further exacerbate WASH needs among affected populations. As of mid-August, the hepatitis E outbreak in Niger is gradually improving, with a sustained decrease in the number of new cases observed since the second peak was attained in week 26, during which 150 cases were reported. During week 32 (week ending 13 August 2017), 37 new suspected cases were reported, compared with 48 in week 31. The trend of hepatitis E cases in Niger has continued to decrease steadily after the last peak in week 26 (week ending 30 June 2017), with the incidence falling below 40 cases per week. During week 39 (week ending 1 October 2017), a total of 39 new cases and zero deaths were reported, compared to 45 cases reported in week 38. All the new cases originated from Diffa District. Since the beginning of the outbreak on 2 January 2017, a total of 1,955 suspected and confirmed cases including 38 deaths (case fatality rate 1.9%) have been reported, as of 2 October 2017. The cases have been reported from five districts, including Diffa (1,216 cases, 7 deaths), Nguigmi (305 cases, 2 deaths), Bosso (244 cases, 2 deaths), Mainé Soroa (11 cases), and Goudoumaria (9 cases). Diffa and Bosso have been the most affected districts, accounting for over 90% of the total cases. The last death occurred on 7 July 2017. New cases of Hepatitis E are still being presented and recorded in the region of Diffa. Since the declaration of the epidemic by the Health authorities on the 19 April 2017, a total of 2,035 cases have been declared with 38 deaths recorded. Up to 25 April the mortality rate was 29 per cent dropping to 1.86 per cent by 24 October. As of 29 December, the outbreak continues to improve.

In El Salvador, 15 people have been killed and 18,622 families have been affected. Thousands have lost their houses, seeking refuge in shelters that have been habilitated for the occasion. The President has declared a 15 days long State of Emergency to deal with the impact of the storm. 2,500 food packages have been delivered to those affected and USD 2 million have been mobilized to assist 1,200 people sheltered around the country. In Guatemala, 44,086 people have been affected, 308 people have lost their houses, 589 people had been evacuated, 72 people are sheltered. National authorities in Guatemala and CONRED are giving assistance to affected people. Evacuations of affected population are aggravating the already difficult shelter situation across the region, with no adequate access to hygiene and sanitation facilities and no prevention measures in place to mitigate COVID-19 spread. The remnants of eastern Pacific Tropical Storm Amanda is forecast to move north-westward over the southeastern portion of the Bay of Campeche and a new tropical depression is likely to form within the next days. Heavy rain is likely to continue over portions of southern Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, and west Honduras during the next few days. After the passage of Tropical Storm AMANDA on 30-31 May, the number of fatalities has increased to at least 23 people, of which 16 in El Salvador, 5 in Honduras, and 2 in Guatemala.

Humanitarian assistance has been delivered to the local population, and the affected countries continue to face the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as by the start of the rainy season in Central America. El Salvador: The Ministry of Foreign affairs requested international assistance, as Amanda and Cristobal affected 29,968 families, roughly some 150,000 people, mostly in the departments of La Libertad, Santa Ana, San Miguel and San Salvador. Guatemala: Amanda and Cristobal caused excessive rainfall and high winds that left flooding and landslides around eastern and central-north Guatemala. The National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED) reports that the storms collectively affected more than 394,000 people as of 4 June, rendering 881 people homeless while also causing two deaths. The storms damaged 880 homes and placed another 967 at risk. CONRED continues to lead the response, but with Guatemala’s mountainous terrain, there are still risks of extra flooding and land movement due to soil saturation. Honduras: Amanda and Cristobal affected 249 families and led to five deaths in Honduras, according to the Permanent Commission for Contingencies (COPECO), who remains concerned with soil saturation increasing the risk of landslides and collapses. Tropical Depression / Storm Amanda has left over 119,000 people affected across El Salvador.

An orange level alert means that there is highly elevated seismicity or fumarolic activity, or both, and other highly unusual symptoms. Eruptions may occur with less than 24 hours’ notice. Monitoring systems are continuously staffed and there is regular visual inspection of potential vent areas as well as continuous ground deformation and hydrothermal monitoring. On 9 April 2021, La Soufrière erupted for the first time after 40 years, sending an ash plume of 10km into the sky. The resulting ashfall was very heavy in the surrounding areas, reaching nearby islands and halting area air traffic. Subsequent eruptions, lava flows, earthquakes, ash plumes, and seismic activity continued throughout April. In early May, explosions subsided, but seismic activity and the risk of lahars persisted with the increased rainfall. An estimated 23,400 people were displaced to the southern end of St Vincent and the Grenadine and some neighbouring countries.',\n",

During epidemiological week 40 (ending 8 October 2023), 16 new cases were reported, including 14 in Arusha, and two in Mara region with no reported deaths. As of 8 October 2023, a total of 268 cholera cases with nine deaths (CFR= 3.3%) have been reported and Most of the cases (61.0%, n=164) were recorded in the Mara region, followed by Arusha (24.0%, n=66) and Kigoma (14.0%, n=38). On 3 October 2023, WHO was notified about a Cholera outbreak affecting three regions of Tanzania Mainland: Mara, bordering Kenya, Arusha and Kigoma. As of 28 October 2023, a total of 548 cases including 14 deaths (CFR 2.6%) were reported from eleven districts of Mara, Kigoma, Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Singida regions. Four cases were admitted in Singida (3) and Arusha (1). Of the 72 samples tested by culture, 53 showed growth of Vibrio cholerae. Women account for 55.5% (304) of cases, and 44.7% (245) of cases are aged between 15 and 44 years.

A total of 1,521 cases and 34 deaths (a Case Fatality Rate of 2.3%) have been recorded. Out of these regions, the cholera outbreak has been declared over in five: Mara, Kigoma, Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Dodoma. However, cases in Mwanza, Shinyanga, Simiyu, and Kagera regions have continued to rise, making them the most affected currently. The increasing trend indicates a risk of further spread without necessary interventions. With the upcoming El Niño and the long rains expected from March to May 2024, there is a likelihood of a rise in cases, potentially affecting more regions. This situation is exacerbated by the current outbreaks in eight regions (Kagera, Ruvuma, Simiyu, Tabora, Shinyanga, Singida, Geita, and Mwanza) with 851 active cases reported since December 23rd, 2023. Most cases (46.8%) are female, with the majority (33.8%) aged between 15 and 49 years.

The incident occurred in the town known as \"El Cayo\", the main population center of the municipality and where the municipal offices, health center, banks, and other commercial and government buildings are located. To date, the causes of the fire are still unclear. There was no Fire Department in the affected areas. Therefore, there was not a speedy response to the incident. According to reports from the Permanent Contingency Commission (COPECO), the fire was 100% controlled around 11:00 a.m. on 2 October, thanks to the deployment of firefighters from the near island of Roatan (located between the islands of Útila and Guanaja) and the regions near the coast of the country of La Ceiba and Tegucigalpa, including members of the Honduran Naval Force and Air Force, which provided boats and helicopters to quell the spread of the fire. There is a long distance, between Guanaja and the main cities; hence supporting a speedy response was not possible (Guanaja – La Ceiba 123 km, Guanaja – Tegucigalpa 299 km). Due to the proximity of the houses and wood as main construction material, the fire spread quickly, affecting approximately half of the territorial extension of El Cayo.

Effective from May 12, 2024, stringent water usage restrictions were enforced across the island. These measures aim to curb wasteful practices and encourage responsible water management during this critical period. The declaration and ensuing water restrictions were prompted by a combination of prolonged drought conditions, insufficient rainfall, and aging water infrastructure. Collectively, this led to critically low water levels in reservoirs. The government implemented several emergency measures to manage the crisis and mitigate its impacts on the population. The 2024 water crisis in Grenada is noted as the most severe in 14 years. This crisis is marked by unprecedented low water levels, significant water rationing, and stringent restrictions on water usage for non-essential activities. The declaration highlighted the extreme nature of the drought and the urgent need for conservation and improved water management strategies to ensure the availability of safe drinking water for the island's residents. Although recent rains have slightly alleviated the situation, water supplies remain insufficient. Farmers are struggling with dry conditions, leading to crop failures and food shortages.

It intensified to a tropical storm about 460 km southeast of Xisha on 25 June and slowed down to 7 km/h while tracking to the west. During the night, Chuck intensified further to a severe tropical storm about 360 km southeast of Xisha and took on a northwestward track towards Hainan Island. On the morning of 26 June, winds of over 100 km/h were reported by a ship, 'Chilham Castle', about 110 km south of the centre of Chuck. Typhoon intensity was attained on the morning of 27 June just before Chuck swept across Xisha Qundao. At Xisha during the closest approach of Chuck, the mean sea-level pressure of 966.2 hPa was recorded. Turning gradually west-northwestwards at 18 km/h, Chuck made landfall over the southern coast of Hainan on the morning of 28 June. A weather observing station (Yaxian: 59948) recorded a mean sea-level pressure of 964.1 hPa as Chuck passed 40 km to its north-northeast that morning. After traversing the southwestern part of Hainan, Chuck entered Beibu Wan that evening. Still maintaining typhoon intensity, Chuck tracked to the northwest at 13 km/h over Beibu Wan. It made landfall over the northern part of Vietnam about 100 km east-southeast of Hanoi on the evening of 29 June and weakened rapidly over land. It finally dissipated in northern Vietnam on 30 June. In Hainan one person was killed and 19 others were injured. Houses damaged or destroyed totalled nearly 29 000. About 54 000 hectares of agricultural land were affected and almost 1 400 heads of livestock were killed. About 100 hectares of fresh water fish ponds were affected and 89 fishing boats capsized. Direct economic loss was estimated at 223 million RMB. Records of storm surge were also reported along the coastal areas of Guangxi. An estimated 7 000 hectares of rice paddy and fish ponds were ruined. More than 700 dykes were damaged and one person was killed. In northern Vietnam where Chuck landed, five people were killed, nine were reported missing and three were injured. Tens of ships capsized and dykes were ruined.

The worst affected were Jubaland, Hirshabelle and South West states. On 27 April, flash floods inundated roads connecting Dhobley and Afmadow districts and its environs in Jubaland State, temporarily making the roads impassable thereby affecting an estimated 60,000 people in the two districts.

At least 67 of the 95 verified settlements for internally displaced people in Hirshabelle were impacted by the rains, affecting about 39,120 people (6,520 households). The Gu (April to June) heavy rains and flash floods spread to more areas of Somalia and affected at least 203,438 people, including around 37,120 displaced or relocated and nine people killed as of 8 May, according to authorities. The floods destroyed and damaged infrastructure including some 3,080 shelters, 4,702 latrines, three schools and killed at least 100 livestock. Shallow wells were submerged and some destroyed, which in turn, posed a risk of cholera outbreak. Additionally, hectares of agricultural land were inundated by the floods, jeopardizing food security and might lead to an increase in price instability.

       "   'disaster_description': \"The El Niño phenomenon has contributed to a prolonged dry season, resulting in crop failure and drought in the Agandugume and Lambewi sub-districts in Puncak District, Central Papua Province. An Emergency Response Status for drought events in the affected sub-districts was declared by the Regent of Puncak District, effective from 7 June to 7 August 2023. According to Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD District Puncak – Central Papua), some 7,500 people (1,800 families) are reportedly experiencing hunger as of 29 July. Essential aid, including food items, non-food items and emergency shelter kits have been distributed by the BPBD Puncak district authorities with support from the Indonesian National Army (TNI) and the Ministry of Social Affairs. The Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) estimates that this dry season will persist until September 2023. According to BMKG, climate phenomena recorded in Pacific Ocean waters in May and June of 2023 triggered El Niño starting June, which further causing the region to feel warmer. Anomalies in Pacific Ocean temperatures have been growing, with the index reaching 0.8, concerningly close to the threshold of 1, at which point the El Niño status goes from “Weak” to “Moderate”. Currently, trends show a consistent increase and by the end of August El Niño status kept on escalating. BMKG forecasted peak of drought season happens starting August and will last until September. Depending on the area affected, Anomalies in Pacific Ocean temperatures may prolong drought to some extent. Therefore, several areas have already impacted by the drought causing water scarcity since June or beginning of August while on the other hand rain still occurs on several area. While the drought peak is not reaching the peak yet, due to the anomalies, some area may experience drought up until October or November. Moreover, BMKG forecasts indicated a high probability that several Indonesian provinces will see rainfall intensity of around 0-20mm below normal during August and September 2023. BMKG has circulated an early warning of potential drought causing water scarcity, particularly in Java and Bali, and the southern part of Sumatra. While on the field, several areas especially in East Java, Banten and Central Java provinces, already declared drought emergency alert even before the BMKG early warning circulated and water scarcity already reported in the area. On the other hand, drought season has impacted crop production in West Papua and affecting food security in the area. Based on PMI situation reports and other resources such as social media, news and articles, water scarcity has been broadly reported. Based on secondary data review and situation at the field, there are approximately 1.2 million people affected by the drought. The number would escalate as drought will last up until September to October according to BKMG forecast. Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) reported 1,185 disasters between July and September 2023, of which majority are drought related. This number is significantly higher compared to the same period in 2022. According to the National Food Agency (NFA), more than half of all provinces in Indonesia were considered food secure by September 2023. Out of 34 provinces, 22 provinces were categorized as stable. 12 provinces were being monitored for possible deterioration for its food security and nutrition situation, compared to 3 last year. The National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) predicted that the ongoing El Niño conditions and its resulting climate conditions over Indonesia is likely to have implications on rice planting and production, even with the regular start of rainy season in November 2023. Additionally, delayed onset of the rainy season could potentially result in reduced rice production by late 2023 and early 2024. According to BMKG, starting in March 2024, the El Niño index will continue to weaken towards a neutral level until the end of the year. Based on the modeling, more and more areas, especially the northern part of Indonesia, will start to experience rainfall or even heavy rainfall. As the phenomenon continues, rainfall, in theory, cannot be the sole indicator of the end of El Niño. Thus, further forecasts will be published based on monthly weather and climate monitoring throughout Indonesia.\",\n",

       "   'disaster_description': \"As vast parts of southern Africa grapple with an unprecedented mid-season dry spell, the food security situation in Mozambique continues to deteriorate. The compounded effects of El Niño, above-average temperatures, extreme weather events such as Tropical Storm Filipo, excessive floods, coupled with the lasting impact of past shocks such as Tropical Cyclone Freddy, are exacerbating the situation. The 2023-2024 El Niño has been one of the strongest on record, bringing below-average rainfall between October 2023 and February 2024 in southern and central Mozambique, and average to above-average rainfall to the northern part of the country. This disruption continues to impact agriculture and rural livelihoods. Between November 2023 and February 2024, typically the rainy season in Mozambique, the southern and central regions of the country experienced persistent dryness and unusually high temperatures, and many areas received less than half of their typical rainfall. These events in turn led to deteriorating vegetation conditions and crop wilting in parts of the central provinces. Around 20 million people reside in areas that have now been hit by drought, 2.7 million of whom were already struggling with food insecurity (IPC3+) before the onset of El Niño. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely to prevail from June to September 2024 in the El Niño-induced drought and conflict-affected areas of Mozambique due to poor harvests, limited income-earning opportunities, and failure to engage in normal livelihoods activities. In addition to these shocks, above-average food prices will make it difficult for poor and very poor households to access food from the markets. In Cabo Delgado, several areas receiving regular humanitarian food assistance will likely be facing Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to expand between October 2024 and January 2025, mainly in the country's central region. The impact of the lean season, which includes the rapid depletion of below-average food stocks for families who were able to harvest some of their own crops, combined with above-average food prices and below average income, will lead to an expansion of areas facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes, particularly in areas affected by the El Niño-induced drought.\",\n",

In Metro Manila, home to 13.5 million people, heavy rainfall caused urban flooding, road closures, and significant disruptions. By 10am local time, the water level in the Marikina River surpassed 18 meters, triggering mandatory evacuation of numerous families, with water levels reaching over 20.7 meters by 7pm. In one area in Quezon City, it was recorded that 458 mm of rain fell within a 24-hour period. In comparison, during Typhoon Ondoy in September 2009, the recorded rainfall over the same duration was 455 mm. Tropical cyclone Gaemi, which has intensified into a Super Typhoon, is expected to make landfall over northern Taiwan before exiting the Philippine Area of Responsibility by noon on 25 July. Moderate to intense rainfall is still expected to continue over the western portion of Luzon until 26 July according to the Philippines weather agency PAGASA. Super Typhoon Gaemi (local name Carina) has been downgraded to a typhoon as it crossed Taiwan and exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on 25 July. The storm, combined with the effects of the southwest monsoon, brought heavy rainfall to the western section of Luzon, including Metro Manila. Flooding incidents have been reported in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Due to the intense amount of rainfall, floodgates were opened for Ipo and Binga dams located in Central and Northern Luzon respectively, which further contributed to flooding incidents. In addition, La Mesa Dam, located near Metro Manila, reached its spilling level, but has since returned to normal levels. Weather is expected to improve in the coming days, but the state weather bureau PAGASA reports heavy to intense rainfall is expected over the western portion of Luzon until 27 July. Tropical cyclone GAEMI made landfall on 25 July in the mid-morning (UTC) over the eastern coast of Fujian province as a tropical storm and is expected to move north-west over the province and dissipate over the Jiangxi province on 27 July. According to the media, in China, more than 240,000 people were temporarily evacuated in the province of Fujian and more than 5,000 rescuers were deployed in the cities of Fuzhou, Putian and Ningde, and Pingtan County. In Taiwan, three people died following its passage on 24 July. In the Philippines, more than 1.3 million people have been affected (in combination with the southwest monsoon) and over 800,000 have been displaced. Tropical cyclone GAEMI affected northern Philippines (22-23 July), northern Taiwan (24 July), and southeastern China (25 July), causing casualties and damage. Taiwan reported ten fatalities, while in China 15 died in a Hunan province landslide, and 3,832 were evacuated due to a river dike breach. In the Philippines, the Department of Social Welfare and Development of the Philippines (DSWD) reports 273,757 displaced, 3,617,365 affected across 11 regions (particularly in northern Philippines) and 1,256 houses damaged or destroyed. Typhoon Gaemi has brought significant flooding and destruction across nine provinces in China, severely affecting Henan, Hunan, Jilin, Liaoning, and Yunnan provinces. In Henan Province, the typhoon resulted in the deaths of four individuals, with three others reported missing, and affected approximately 87,000 people. In Liaoning Province, more than 14,500 residents were relocated following an orange alert, indicating a high risk of severe weather.

It is estimated that only 24 per cent of the usually worked land has been cultivated for the upcoming season. Surveys indicate that up to 70 per cent of households have had to reduce food consumption as food prices have reportedly increased by 73 per cent in the last two years. Hospitals in the country report shortages of essential medicines and other health items, while frequent power outages affect the delivery of health services. The shortage of medicines has paralyzed about 50 per cent of medical operations in the country. The multi-dimensional crisis in Sri Lanka has inevitably brought more protection issues to the pre-existing chronic inequalities experienced by its people. An estimated 5.7 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in 25 districts across the country.',\n",

The Government announced a two-week shutdown of government services and schools in Colombo to reduce the number of people taking private and public transportation as fuel stocks are predicted to run out in five days. WFP activated an emergency response to the food crisis, focusing on urgent programmes to save lives and mitigate growing food insecurity among 3 million of the most vulnerable people of Sri Lanka from June through December 2022. As of 15 September, over 1 million people in need across all 25 districts have been reached with humanitarian assistance. Through the provision of essential medicines and supplies to health facilities, over 660,000 people were able to benefit from improved access to healthcare. Partners were also able to disburse over US$ 2.2 million of cash assistance and reach over 102,000 people with in-kind food assistance. Other life-saving initiatives are being rolled out across the sectors of food security, agriculture, nutrition, water, protection, education, and health to address urgent needs. As of 15 March 2023, some 1,246,000 people have received in-kind food or cash and voucher assistance. 973,000 people received agriculture and livelihoods support and 2.3 million people received nutritional support, primarily through school meals. About 805,000 people benefitted from WASH interventions, while 311,000 and 564,000 people benefitted from Health and Education assistance, respectively.',\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'Unlike in 2017 when the rains were poor, the above average Gu rains in April this year are already worsening conditions in overcrowded Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) settlements and displacing more people along riverine areas due to flooding. In Baidoa, half of the estimated more than 246,000 IDPs, are at the risk of flash flooding. In Galgadud region, heavy rains resulted in flash floods that destroyed IDPs shelters in settlements in low lying land in Abudwaq town. An estimated 9,300 displaced people in Danwadaag, Kulmiye and Wadajir settlements have been affected and an unknown number has moved to Cadaado town until flooding recedes. In Jubaland, an estimated 28,200 people have been displaced by flash flooding. This includes 8,000 in Saakow; 6,000 in Bu’ale; 6,000 in Luuq; 6,000 in Afmadow; 1,200 in Ceel Waaq villages and some 7,000 people in Jilib and Jamaame riverine areas who have been temporarily displaced to nearby highland areas. In Middle Shabelle, the Shabelle River burst its banks displacing people in Horseed area. Farms and IDP shelter were washed away. Some 7,000 affected people have moved to Hantiwadaag village in Jowhar. According to partners, an estimated 13,000 have been affected by flooding. In Hiraan region, thousands of people have been affected after the Shabelle River burst its banks and its inlets overflowed into parts of Belet Weyne town and several riverine villages inundating houses and crops. Overall, more than 427,000 people have been affected as of 26 April and of these nearly 175,000 have been displaced as a result of the flash and river flooding in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region, according to data collected by humanitarian partners. Flash and river flooding has so far affected an estimated 630,000 people. More than 214,800 of these have been displaced from their homes following the heavy rains received across the country in April, according to the UNHCR-led Protection & Return Monitoring Network (PRMN). An estimated 772,500 people have been affected by the flooding and more than 229,000 are displaced, according to PRMN. According to the FEWS NET and FSNAU, the food security outcomes are likely to be more severe than previously projected for many families in areas affected by flooding, especially in riverine areas of Hirshabelle, Jubaland and some agropastoral areas of South West State. In these areas, several roads are now impassible and trade flows are expected to slow, driving food prices higher. Cases of AWD/Cholera are expected to rise as flood waters stagnate and remaining clean drinking water sources are compromised. There has been a significant reduction in rainfall levels in the Juba and Shabelle river basins in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands over the last two weeks, with most areas receiving only light rainfall, if any. According to SWALIM, the forecast for the coming week calls for clear weather, with the exception of coastal areas of Lower Shabelle and Lower Juba in Jubaland State. This signifies the gradual end of the 2018 Gu rainy season, which has seen above-average rainfall during April and early May. Some river breakages have not yet been closed in the mid-lower parts of the Shabelle river and therefore there remains a moderate risk of flooding. River levels along the Juba river have been gradually decreasing, which has reduced the risk of flood. An estimated 830,000 people have been affected, of which nearly 290,000 have been temporarily displaced due to flooding.',\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'July 2010 marked a particularly tragic period in Pakistan’s history. In the north, three days of unstoppable rain caused the Indus River to swell, creating a massive body of water that moved from the Himalayas, southwards to the Arabian Sea. The disaster became more destructive than the Haiti earthquake and the Japan tsunami combined. The monsoon rains that lashed Pakistan from the end of July through August 2010 caused the country’s worst flooding since 1929. The northwest of the country, particularly the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was the first area to be affected. The situation deteriorated with the passing weeks as flooding spread to two other major food-producing provinces, the Punjab and Sindh, both densely populated, in August and September. Out of a population of 168 million, at least 20 million people were affected by the floods, losing their homes and livelihoods, mainly across the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh. The floods also affected people in Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-Administered-Kashmir. More than 1700 people died, more than 7 million were left homeless and at least 1.8 million homes were destroyed. Over 2.4 million hectares of standing crops were submerged, and 450,000 heads of livestock lost. Within a period of one and a half months, 78 districts out of Pakistan’s 141 districts were affected, and as of 24 October 2010, the government’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported that there had been 1,985 deaths and 2,946 people injured by the floods. Out of the estimated 22.2 million hectares of agricultural land, almost two million hectares were destroyed in the floods, threatening severe food shortages in the coming months. More than 400 hospitals and health clinics were damaged or destroyed, as well as education facilities, power and transmission lines, telecommunication networks and industrial infrastructure. In Punjab, the breadbasket of Pakistan, experienced a combination of flash floods in the mountains and highly destructive river flooding in agricultural areas. An estimated six million people were affected across eleven districts. More than 500,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. And more than 1.85 million acres of arable land was washed away. The most severely affected districts were: Muzzafargarh, Rajanpur, Mianwali, R.I. Khan, Layyah, D.G. Khan, and Bhakkar. The direct impact of the floods has been the most protracted in Sindh. Close to half of the rural population was affected, with millions evacuated or forced to flee. At the peak of the crisis vast swathes of the province were left underwater, critical because the majority of the people rely on agriculture for their survival. More than seven million people were affected and more than 875,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. More than 2.5 million acres of arable land was submerged, resulting in a problem with nutrition, especially among the young. In March 2011, more than 100,000 people were still in camps or settlements. The most severely affected districts were: Kashmore, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Larkana, Qambar-Shahdadkot, Thatta, Dadu, and Jamshoro.',\n",

Governmental and humanitarian partners have been called upon to support the response. Ennedi-ouest - Severe rain leaves 80 per cent of village damaged and 850 people affected: Through its Emergency Tracking Tool (ETT), IOM reported 120 households (850 individuals) impacted by heavy rains and severe flooding on 7 July, in the village of Wadi-Doum, 215 kms from Faya. The flooding has caused critical damage to homes, businesses and community gardens: all 10 community gardens, which were the community’s main sources of food, were gravely damaged, 120 houses have been flooded, leaving 99 households without shelter. Almost half of all wells -the only water sources in this desert area- were partially damaged and two of the three latrines in the village were completely damaged. Water levels are decreasing slowly but approximately 80 per cent of Wadi-Doum has reportedly sustained serious material damages. As of 28 July, floods have affected around 25,000 people in Tandjile and Mandoul provinces in the south, and Ennedi-Ouest province in the north. On 26 June, devastating floods killed five people, wounded 231 and destroyed 4,413 houses.

Preliminary reports indicate flooding and wind damage as Eta continues its projected westward path over northern Nicaragua. The United States’ National Hurricane Center (NHC) projects that Eta will cross into central Honduras by midday on 4 November and then reach eastern Guatemala and Belize on 5 November at night, passing over northern El Salvador during this time, before turning north-east back out into the Caribbean Sea by 7 November. Eta has downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves into eastern and central Honduras at 11 km/h with windspeeds of 65 km/h. Despite Eta’s decreased intensity and lower windspeeds, Nicaragua continues to take on moderate, but persistent, rainfall throughout much of the country, with meteorological forecasts citing more than 600mm through 8 November. Eta’s slow movement and ongoing impact, coupled with the remote locations of areas along Nicaragua’s north-eastern Caribbean shores that have taken the brunt of Eta’s effects, are limiting full and complete evaluations. Eta is expected to continue weakening as it interacts with mountainous terrain in Nicaragua and Honduras, potentially weakening to a tropical depression by 4 November at night. Nicaragua’s National Disaster Prevention System (SINAPRED) reports that Eta, now on its way out of Nicaragua, has thus far caused two deaths due to a landslide in the mining area of Bonanza. Preliminary reports cite material damages, uprooted trees, interruptions to power supply, flooding and blocked roads and affected bridges. Official sources report that there are 30,000 people sheltered across 48 installations, including churches, schools, shelters and family homes. After almost a month since the landfall of Eta, Nicaragua estimates over 3 million people affected, as well as significant infrastructure damages in 56 municipalities, including approximately 43,000 damaged / destroyed homes. The Government response continues to focus on restoring basic service access for water, power and telecommunications. Eta’s rains are also causing flooding, damages and humanitarian impacts in Honduras, with the Permanent Commission for Contingencies (COPECO) reporting more than 3,480 people affected and 1 death as of 12:00am local time 4 November. Honduran Armed Forces report supporting the evacuation of more than 2,500 people, indicating that 1,340 are in shelters. Material damages include nearly 350 affected homes, as well as several road blockages that have cut off 41 communities. With Eta crossing into Honduras, outer band rains began falling over Guatemala in the past 24 hours, triggering flooding in several areas. Per the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED), the rains and subsequent flooding and landslides have thus far affected 27,770 people across the departments of Alta Verapaz, Petén, Quiché and Sololá. In El Salvador, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) reports that Eta is causing high winds of up to 30 km/h in parts of the capital of San Salvador that have already led to fallen trees and debris. The National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) anticipates that Eta’s major threat is heavy rainfall and flooding, with some locations across the country already taking on 50mm of rain. NEMO expects rainfall to last until 9-11 November, posing a high flood risk across Belize. In Costa Rica, the National Emergency Commission (CNE) reports that hazardous rains related to Eta have affected 79 communities, mostly in the north-western Pacific coast. CNE, who have deployed response teams to affected areas, adds that there are 500 people in 16 shelters, a number they expect to rise as persistent rainfall continues to affect the country. The National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC) reports that rains related to Eta have damaged some 213 homes in western and central Panama communities. Additionally, landslides in the north-western Ngäbe Buglé indigenous territory have affected about 1,000 people. Heavy rain due to the influence of Hurricane ETA affected the southern States of Mexico (particularly Chiapas, Tabasco and Veracruz) over the past few days, causing floods, triggering landslides and leading to casualties and damage. Three weeks after Hurricane Eta struck Central America, authorities continue assessing the damages and gathering information on the affected communities. As of 25 November, the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) reported that there were 109 families, including 258 children still in shelters. A total of 354 families, including 769 children remain severely impacted from the floods and in need of urgent assistance, particularly in the Cayo District.',\n",

Eight Rayons, with a total population of approximately half a million, needed priority emergency assistance.

So far 63 people are reported dead, of which 33 are laboratory-confirmed (1.55 per cent mortality). During this same period, 12 departments (66.6 per cent of the entire country) reported high incidence of dengue. In view of this scenario, on 14 June the Government of Honduras declared a Health Emergency in these departments. The most affected departments are Cortés (4,200 cases), Yoro (1,083 cases), Olancho (855 cases) and Santa Bárbara (643 cases). If we add the 1,042 cases reported in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan Region, we see that 75 per cent of all cases reported to date are in north-western Honduras (8,647 / 11,436 cases). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Honduras presents 77.5 per cent of dengue cases reported in America. The Government is allocating more than US$10 million for public institutions to respond to the dengue outbreak currently gripping Honduras. Additionally, the Government will allocate more than $2 million to affected municipalities for dengue response. As of epidemiological week 29, Honduras has seen 33,840 cases, with 8,662 cases of severe dengue and 150 deaths. Of Honduras’ 32 public hospitals, 26 are overrun with cases; officials have postponed planned operations to manage the volume of cases. El Salvador reported 8,893 cases so far this year, a 220 per cent increase from the 2,700 cases registered in the same reporting period in 2018. There are nine deaths currently under investigation for suspected links to the disease. Hospitalizations are also up with 2,241 in 2019 compared to 643 in 2018. The Ministry is also reporting an 88 per cent increase in Zika cases and 64 per cent increase in Chikungunya cases. Guatemala has, as of 13 July, some 8,370 cases of dengue. Health authorities note that there have only been 38 cases of severe dengue, resulting in 27 deaths, including 18 children. Although the cases through 13 July are nearly double the cases in 13 July 2017, they are well below the peak of 19,700 cases through 13 July in 2014. Most cases are in the departments of Escuintla, Huehuetenango, Izabal, Quetzaltenango and San Marcos. Central America is experiencing an outbreak of dengue fever since April 2019, with approximately 10,000 suspected cases reported across the region so far. The highest number is reported in Nicaragua with 49,929 suspected cases (of which 1,862 are laboratory-confirmed) and in Honduras with 34,840 cases (of which 58 are laboratory-confirmed deaths). A significant increase in dengue cases has been reported in Paraguay in recent weeks. According to PAHO's report for Epidemiology Week No. 7 (EW7 until February 15), dengue cases have increased to 106,127 suspected cases, 20,837 new cases (EW7) and 20 people who have died from the disease. These figures have surpassed the security ranges and epidemiological trends of past years, with the cases drastically increasing in the first seven weeks of 2020.

A landslide occurred in Kandy District on 13 May, resulting in two injured people. At least 44,153 people across the aforementioned Provinces have been affected, while up to 618 houses have been partially damaged. On 17-18 May, rain with thunderstorms is forecast over Central, Sabaragamuwa, Uva, Eastern and North-Central Provinces. The southwest monsoon and activation of a depression which was later developed to tropical cyclone “Tauktae” over the southeast Arabian sea triggered heavy rainfall in Sri Lanka from 12 to 14 May 2021. Western, South and Sabaragamuawa provinces of Sri Lanka were worst affected. Sri Lanka’s Department of Meteorology has reported a maximum rainfall up to 336 millimeters in the Western province particularly in Kalutara district. During this period five deaths have been reported in Gampaha, Galle and Kegalle districts. Even though rain has stopped, the affected low-lying areas are still inundated with floods in the nine districts in five provinces and have caused damages to residential areas. Agricultural lands and standing crops have also been inundated and damaged as well as the infrastructures. Sri Lanka Metrological department predicts heavy rainfall on 22-25 May and the possibility of continuation of flooding, which may increase the impact and further exacerbate the situation with further reduction of coping capacity of vulnerable households in the affected areas. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) situation report as of 17 May, 43,701 people (11,247 families) have been affected across 9 districts, and 5 deaths were reported. In these districts, 16 houses are fully damaged, and 1,453 houses are partially damaged, and 166 facilities of small and medium enterprises have also been damaged. A total of 29 evacuation centres/Safety locations are activated and 377 families (1,658 people) are located in these centres. Eight road embankment failure incidents were reported from Kegalle District which caused two fatalities. The DMC is coordinating the national response efforts. Water sources of the area have been contaminated due to heavy rain and the overflow of sewerage pits/septic tanks are open to public water facilities. Therefore, DMC reveal that there is a need for drinking water, wells and area cleaning. Due to activation of South-West monsoon winds, very heavy rains were received during 2 June to 5 June, and most parts of the South Western region received more than 300mm rainfall within 24 hours and maximum reported was 346mm in Dummalasooriya on 3 June (Puttalam district). As a result due to heavy rainfall, strong winds and few landslides a total of 245,212 people (60,674 families) got affected in 10 districts, since 2 May. Furthermore, 14 deaths were reported, and two persons suffered minor injuries while two persons were missing due to floods and cutting failures. A total amount of 15,658 people (3,520 families) have been highly impacted and evacuated to 72 safety centres set up to assist the displaced. Most of these safety centres are in the Colombo (32), Gampaha (16), Kalutara (10) and Ratnapura (10) districts. Some 3,397 of these displaced people are residing with relatives or friends houses. Heavy rain and strong winds have been affecting parts of western Sri Lanka since 3 June, causing floods and landslides, which have resulted in casualties. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), 17 people have died, five have been injured and two others are missing.

Damage has been reported to about 1,000 buildings. The International Disaster Charter for floods and flash floods was activated on 5 June. Early warnings for landslide events have been issued for Western and Sabaragamuwa (southern Sri Lanka) Provinces, while on 7-8 June, heavy rain is forecast over the same Provinces. Heavy rain and strong winds continue to affect particularly western and south-western Sri Lanka, causing floods and landslides, which have resulted in an increased human impact. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), 20 people have died and five individuals remain injured. The number of total affected people stands at 176,419 and up to 7,989 individuals have been displaced to either evacuation centres or relatives' houses across ten Districts of Sri Lanka. Damage has been reported to more than 1,100 buildings. On 9-10 June, heavy rain is forecast over Western, Sabaragamuwa (southern Sri Lanka) and North-western Provinces. As of 11 June, floodwater receded considerably, about 90% the families have returned to either their own places or staying with host families. Since 98% houses are partially damaged people prefer to stay in their own places while working on repairs. Heavy rain and strong winds have been affecting the Central Province of Sri Lanka, causing floods and resulting in casualties and damage. According to the Disaster Management Centre of Sri Lanka, one person died and another has been injured in Kandy District. In addition, 2,113 people have been affected and 122 houses damaged across the Districts of Kandy and Nuwara Eliya.

The orange alert means that government institutions are planning for an impending disaster. Continued rainfall has been forecast for the first quarter of 2017. Rains are expected to continue, which will increase the number of people affected. The risk of vector- and water-borne diseases is particularly high, as both cholera and malaria are endemic and outbreaks recurring. In Malawi, due to La Niña weather phenomenon since the onset of the rainy season, many districts have received normal to above normal rainfall triggering flash floods in some of the districts. Between 4 and 10 February, heavy rain caused the worst flooding in Salima District in four Traditional Authorities of Ndindi, Pemba, Kambwiri and Maganga. A total of 35,304 people have been affected. 7,216 people have been displaced and are homeless and are dwelling in school blocks. On 15 February, Tropical Cyclone Dineo made landfall near Inhambane, Southern Mozambique. Shortly after, the storm evolved from severe tropical storm to Category III Tropical Cyclone and was reclassified as Ex-Dineo. The initial report indicated 3 deaths and 4 injured, damaged Infrastructure (electricity, and roads) as a result of the storm in the affected areas. The National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) projects that urban flooding in small villages and cities may affect 200,000 people over the next 7 days and the following river basins would be at risk of flooding. Between January and March 2017, Zimbabwe experienced severe flooding across 37 districts of the country, which damaged local infrastructure, livelihoods, transportation routes, and homes.

       "   'disaster_description': \"Mongolia is currently facing a severe Dzud. This slow-onset disaster is unique to Mongolia and results from summer droughts followed by heavy snowfalls and extreme cold, leading to insufficient grazing pastures and hence underfed animals resulting in increased livestock mortality. As of 30th December 2023, over 90% of the country has been affected by extreme Dzud conditions, with 160 soums across 20 provinces being identified as high-risk areas. Over 258,000 people, including 100,000 children (51,000 girls and 49,000 boys) are affected due to roads blocked by snow, preventing children from accessing vital health, nutrition, education and protective services. Herder families, who are most directly impacted by the Dzud, often have to leave their children in the care of relatives or at boarding schools, increasing protection risks and causing psychological stress. As a result of the Dzud, the number of livestock losses increased from 49,000 in November 2023 to 284,242 by 26 January 2024. The Otor Movement is a nomadic practice of domestic herders migrating to seek pasture: From early November 2023, 18,859 herder families (67,892 people) have been on the Otor Movement. As of January 2024, 7,570 families moved to the state-protected area (the Mongolian government is using its last pasture resort, where settlement is prohibited because there are endangered plants and animals under State protection), 2,322 families moved to other provinces, 4,303 families moved within their province, 2,907 moved to the border, 1,047 moved to the provincial border (in and out between 2 provinces), and only 710 families moved in soum borders. While the Otor movement is beneficial for livestock, it requires tremendous efforts from herder families to frequently relocate, forcing them to live in roughly built shelters and being isolated from basic services. The intensity of the dzud is impacting those on the Otor Movement more than in previous years, and the number of people on the Otor Movement is higher than in previous years. The current white and iron dzud in Mongolia has resulted in a critical situation, with 90% of the country facing high risk. The herding communities are struggling with inadequate feed and skyrocketing feed prices, leading to heightened vulnerabilities. The increasing severity of weather conditions further exacerbates the crisis, underscoring the urgent need for humanitarian assistance and sustainable solutions to support Mongolia's rural communities and traditional livelihoods. According to the national Emergency Operations Center (EOC), there are 13,573 households currently residing in snow blocked areas, as of 18 February 2024. Between November 2023 to February 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 150,500 people, including 62,500 children (31,500 girls and 31,000 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 89 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 1,430 people trapped by heavy snow. According to EOC, 9 casualties due to snowstorms, including 1 child, have been reported. The number of livestock perished reached 667,841 as of 19 February 2024, which is significantly higher compared to past years’ data. However, the peak of livestock mortality is yet to come and expected to occur from late February to April 2024. As of 22 February, media report one fatality and more than 1.5 million livestock losses across the country. Essential aids have been provided since 19 February. The livestock mortality rate reportedly reached 4.8 per cent by 29 February, representing some 3.1 million heads of livestock – nearly a million more livestock deaths than a week ago and nearly 6.5 times as many livestock deaths as this time last year. Livestock deaths are expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks, potentially exceeding the national-level 6 per cent disaster threshold. At the province (aimag) level, the most severe impacts this season have been recorded in the eastern regions, with four aimags already exceeding the threshold – Sukhbaatar (24.4 per cent), Dornogovi (14.7 per cent), Govisumber (11.2 per cent), and Hentii (9.6 per cent). With around 190,000 herder households grappling with insufficient feed, soaring prices and heightened vulnerabilities, the worsening weather conditions are exacerbating a crisis, highlighting the urgent need for support and sustainable interventions to bolster rural communities and traditional livelihoods in Mongolia. According to the Dzud Map produced by NAMEM on 26 February 2024, 76 per cent of the country is currently affected by white and ice/Iron Dzud types. Several additional key factors have contributed to the escalation of the Dzud to an exceptional level this winter: numerous blizzards since November 2023, extensive snow coverage across the country, and fluctuating temperatures with periods of intense cold/freezing, followed by warm phases/snow melting, and then refreezing, leaving no grazing options for livestock (sheep, cows, horses, and camels). Consequently, hay and fodder stocks had to be utilised a few months earlier than in usual winters. The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), established by the government of Mongolia last December, has reported a rapid increase in livestock mortality from the second half of February 2024, with the latest official figures as of 14 March 2024 indicating over 4,7 million dead animals (compared to 612,000 dead animals on 21 February). This represents 7 per cent of the national livestock (up from 0.94 per cent on 21 February). While the numbers are increasing fast, this situation is already twice as critical as last year's Dzud, and the government estimates that this year will be far more severe than the worst Dzud recorded in 2010. On 14 February 2024, the Government of Mongolia passed a resolution declaring a heightened readiness level until 15 May due to the severe Dzud affecting the country nationwide (priority support and involvement in crisis management, at all governmental levels). According to EOC figures, as of the end of February, 185,937 herder households, constituting 75 per cent of all herder households, have been directly or indirectly affected by the Dzud’s impacts. About 100,000 herder families are considered the most vulnerable households. As of 7 March 2024, 1,344 herders have lost their entire livestock, and 18,859 herder families are currently on the Otor movement (a nomadic winter coping mechanism used in past years by herder communities in Mongolia to provide livestock access to pasture). Between November 2023 and March 2024, severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affected over 90% of the country. Over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys) are affected by the extreme weather conditions. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) search and rescue teams have responded to more than 114 alert calls for missing people, rescuing over 3,757 people, including 721 children, trapped by heavy snow. The situation has escalated significantly compared to previous years, with March 2024 witnessing conditions twice as severe as the last dzud event, and the worst since 2010. Current livestock mortality rates have already soared to 8.1% of 64.7 million livestock, with 2,257 herder households having lost more than 70% of their livestock. The severity of the situation has prompted a revision of the Dzud Response Plan for 2023/2024, which complements the Government of Mongolia’s planned response. The plan revised by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) now aims to deliver immediate and life-saving assistance to 76,000 people out of the 200,000 people in need identified by the HCT through a coordinated approach with early warning and early action to respond to needs triggered by the Dzud. Health concerns are escalating, with restricted food availability leading to nutritional deficiencies among herder households. The remote location of many herder families, combined with a lack of fuel and prioritization of livestock over healthcare, severely limits access to medical services, which are available at the provincial and soum levels. The need to dispose of more than five million animal carcasses is urgent, as yellow floods are expected with spring temperatures set to melt an exceptional amount of snow this year. The government has begun to safely bury animal carcasses through collection points along roads, with areas near rivers being prioritized to contain public health risks. Between November 2023 and April 2024, Mongolia experienced the harshest dzud in the last fifty years, with severe blizzards and harsh weather conditions affecting over 188,300 people, including 80,215 children (40,830 girls and 39,385 boys). Twenty people, including two children, have lost their lives due to severe blizzard. The dzud has mostly affected herder households, whose main/sole income source for livelihood is livestock. As of 25 April 2024, 4957 herder households had lost more than 70 per cent of their livestock and the country has lost 7.1 million livestock, amounting to 11.1 per cent of the total. Despite the temperature beginning to rise and the spring months ahead, dzud conditions persist and the loss of livestock is expected to continue in the coming months. Although the severe winter condition subsided, livestock that had been exhausted and starved for long period continued to perish well into May. By mid-May 2024, the number of livestock loss reached 7.2 million, amounting to 11.6 percent of the total. The impact of the dzud impact on the herder households continues to affect the livelihood, mental health, wellbeing, nutritional and education needs of over 24,000 children. Amid the dzud recovery efforts, there is a high risk of flooding in central and eastern parts of Mongolia, posing increasing challenges for the vulnerable population in flood-prone areas. Official estimates indicate that about 7.9 million heads of livestock perished due to the 2023/24 Dzud, with the highest losses occurring in Sukhbaatar, Khentii, Arkhangai, Tuv and Dornogovi provinces (locally known as aimags) located in the eastern and central parts of the country. The death toll accounts for 12.3 percent of the national herd, significantly exceeding the average mortality rate recorded during the same period in the previous five years and is the highest level since 2010. The loss of livestock has a direct negative effect on the income of a large number of people in the country as over a quarter of the total population is engaged in livestock‑rearing activities. Reduced income and high prices of staple foods are expected to erode the purchasing power of most vulnerable herder households, constraining their access to food. In addition to the Dzud impacts, the Emergency Operation Center (EOC) addressed the high risk of “yellow” floods due to accumulated snowfall and livestock carcasses in Dzud-affected regions by the end of May 2024. However, NAMEM issued warning for potential floods during summertime from high precipitation levels forecasted. From June to August 2024, heavy rains and floods affected several Dzud-affected regions including Uvurkhangai, Tuv, Zavkhan, and Umnugobi, directly and indirectly impacting over 1,300 people and leading to the loss of 22,000 livestock. Furthermore, a series of wildfire struck the region most affected by the dzud including Khentii, Dornod, Sukhbaatar provinces between 11-16 October, directly affecting 21 families, resulting in the loss of two children and 1,000 livestock, and burning 16 hectares of pastureland. These recurring hazards continue to compound the difficulties faced by Dzud-affected herder communities. As of 25 October, NAMEM has issued seasonal weather forecasts for October 2024 to January 2025 and MoFALI has updated pasture carrying capacity estimates and September update on the winter preparation for 2024/2025. According to NAMEM forecast, the temperatures may fluctuate between October, November, December 2024, and January 2025, with warmer conditions anticipated for October and November but colder-than-average temperatures predicted for December 2024 and January 2025, raising concerns for a possible ice/iron Dzud situation.\",\n",

It is anticipated that the situation will have an impact on both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture/livestock, as well as on the availability of water for drinking, washing, and sanitation. Mid-March through to the end of July will likely be the peak period during which drought impacts on crops and livestock (agricultural drought) would manifest. The wheat production deficit is expected to be 16 to 27 per cent this year and as a result, requiring increased top-up from international suppliers.

From 01 to 27 January 2019, a total of 213 confirmed cases including 41 deaths were reported from sixteen states (Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Bauchi, Plateau, Taraba, Gombe, Anambra, Kaduna, Kwara, FCT, Benue, Rivers, Nassarawa and Kogi States) across 40 Local Government Areas (LGAs). This represents a significant increase in the number of cases reported compared to at the same period in 2018. The number of confirmed cases reported across Nigeria remains high. In week 6, 2019 (week ending 10 February 2019), 37 new confirmed cases including 10 deaths (case fatality ratio = 27%) were reported from nine states across Nigeria. The majority of cases were reported from Ondo (12) and Edo (10) states. The number of confirmed cases reported in week 6, 2019 represents a slight decrease compared to week 5 when 68 confirmed cases were reported. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has reported a decrease in the number of Lassa fever cases reported weekly in the country. In the last reporting week ending on the 17th February 2019, 25 new confirmed cases of Lassa fever were reported. So far, a total of 355 confirmed cases with 75 deaths have been recorded between January 1st and February 17th, 2019 from 20 states across 57 Local Government Areas. Over the past three weeks, there has been a downward trend in new cases. Cases of Lassa fever continue to be reported across Nigeria in 2019, with a declining trend since week 10. During week 15 (week ending on 14 April 2019), three new confirmed cases with zero deaths were reported from two states – Edo (one) and Plateau(two). This is the lowest number of cases reported since the beginning of the year, with more than 80 cases reported during the peak of the outbreak in week 4 (week ending on 27 January 2019). From 1 January to 14 April 2019, a cumulative total of 555 confirmed and probable cases with 137 deaths (case fatality ratio 24.7%) have been reported across Nigeria. Eighty-one local government areas across 21 states have reported at least one confirmed case since the beginning of 2019. The Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria is still ongoing. Since our last report in week 16 of 2019 (week ending 21 April 2019) sporadic cases have continued to be reported across 86 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 23 states, resulting in a cumulative total of 793 confirmed cases reported between 1 January and 1 December 2019. A significant upsurge in the number of cases was noted in the first three weeks of 2020. Between 1 and 19 January 2020, a cumulative total of 398 suspected cases was reported nationally. On 25 January, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced the activation of a national emergency operations center (EOC) following an escalation of Lassa fever outbreak across different zones of the country. From 1 to 24 January alone, at least 195 confirmed cases and 29 deaths were recorded across 11 states with the southern Ondo, Edo and Ebonyi states reporting the highest number (89 per cent) of cases. The outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria continues to propagate, with new states being affected weekly. Between 1 January and 2 February 2020, a cumulative total of 1 226 suspected cases were reported in Nigeria. Among these, a total of 365 confirmed cases were recorded from 74 local government areas (LGAs) in 23 states. The Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria continues, with a high incidence of cases and deaths reported and new states being affected. Between 1 January and 23 February 2020, a cumulative total of 2 633 suspected cases were reported across Nigeria. Of these, a total of 689 cases coming from 115 local government areas (LGAs) in 27 states were confirmed, Among the 689 confirmed cases, 118 deaths have occurred, giving a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 17.1% among confirmed cases, which is relatively lower compared to the CFR for the same period in 2019 (21.8%). The Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria has greatly improved, with only a few sporadic cases being reported. The disease trend has been steadily declining since week 7 (2020) when a peak of 115 confirmed cases (with 18 deaths) were reported. However, in week 16 (week ending 19 April 2020), a total of six new confirmed cases (with no deaths) have been reported, compared to 10 confirmed cases reported in week 15.

Malawi, which now has an estimated 3.3 million people in Crisis or Emergency (IPC phase 3 and 4), and Zimbabwe, where nearly 2.4 million people are in Crisis or Emergency, have the highest numbers of severely food insecure people in the region. Meanwhile, three districts in Zimbabwe and two districts in Madagascar were classified in Emergency (IPC phase 4) at the outset of the lean season, as a result of extreme loss of livelihood assets. There are also pockets of people facing Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4) in Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique. Since the start of the 2018/19 cropping season in October, anomalous dry conditions have developed across parts of Southern Africa, with more intense moisture deficits registered in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, in addition to the western parts of Madagascar. Although there are a few months remaining in the cropping season, with the main harvest period usually commencing in April, the impact of the reduced rains is expected to have caused a contraction in the area planted and lowered yield prospects, particularly in the aforementioned areas. Heavier rainfall since mid‑December provided some respite and helped to alleviate moisture deficits, but concurrently resulted in localized flooding in parts of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Approximately 10.8 million people were facing severe food insecurity in Southern Africa as 2018 came to an end. In Eswatini, the estimated number of people facing Crisis (IPC phase 3) or worse food insecurity more than doubled from 120,000 in October to nearly 250,000 in December. In Zimbabwe, where 2.4 million people in rural areas were severely food insecure, the deteriorating economic situation caused sharp price increases and hampered access to food and agricultural inputs. Shortages of basic food commodities in formal markets, including cooking oil, sugar and bread, were reported, especially in remote areas. In Mozambique, more than 1.78 million people were in IPC phase 3 or above across the country, of whom 814,000 people in five provinces were prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance. Further attacks by non-state armed actors were reported in Cabo Delgado province in November, increasing food security and malnutrition concerns. Meanwhile, in Madagascar, a Flash Appeal was launched to galvanize funding for rapid response in the Grand Sud region, where 890,000 people are severely food insecure. FEWS NET anticipates the next lean season will most likely start atypically early in August/September in several areas of the region, and households will have limited purchasing power due to lower incomes. Additionally, household access to milk will be lower than normal driven by poor livestock body conditions. Consequently, atypically high levels of acute food insecurity are likely during the 2019/20 lean season in most countries across the region, except in Madagascar, Malawi, and northern Mozambique. Atypically high needs will also be driven by conflict in DRC and poor macroeconomic conditions in Zimbabwe. Although outcomes are not expected to be as severe as those following the 2015/16 drought, humanitarian partners should prepare for a likely earlier than normal start to the 2019/20 lean season and higher than normal food assistance needs during this time. President Hage Geingob [of Namibia] yesterday declared the current drought affecting 23 arid and semi-arid counties and pockets of other areas a national disaster. Since 2013, most parts of Namibia recorded below normal rainfall, thereby leaving the grazing land exhausted and with little recovery. An estimated 41.2 million people in 13 SADC Member States are food insecure this year. When comparing the 11 Member States that provided data last year, food insecurity increased by 28%. It is also 7.4% higher than it was during the severe El Niño-induced drought of 2016/17. The overall food security situation in the region is deteriorating and the number of severely food insecure people is rising in some countries, reaching a peak between October 2019 and March 2020. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes prevail in cyclone affected areas of Mozambique and Zimbabwe and areas significantly affected by the drought and the deteriorating macro-economic context in Zimbabwe. Emergency (IPC 4) outcomes prevail in parts of Southern Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique and Eswatini. Poor crop performance due to variable and late rainfall affected significant portions of Lesotho, Eswatini, southern Madagascar, and southern Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, while the impact of cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused damage and destruction to harvests in eastern Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, and central and north Mozambique. A record 45 million people across the 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) will be severely food insecure in the next six months, United Nations food agencies have warned. There are more than 11 million people now experiencing “crisis” or “emergency” levels of food insecurity (IPC Phases 3 and 4 in nine Southern African countries: Angola, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, Eswatini and Lesotho. The UN food agencies are escalating their responses across the nine countries, planning to assist more than 11 million people by mid-2020. In addition to addressing urgent food and nutrition needs, they will help smallholder farmers boost production and reduce losses, manage precious soil and water resources in a sustainable way and embrace climate-smart agricultural practices, better access to inputs, credit and markets, and spearhead vaccination campaigns to contain livestock disease. The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has welcomed a US$3.39 million contribution from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to help meet the immediate food needs of drought-affected people in Zambia. The US support, confirmed in December 2019, comes at a moment of increasing needs, after drought and prolonged dry spells have left 2.3 million people severely food insecure and in need of assistance. Through this funding, WFP will deliver 2,380 MT of pulses to complement the Government’s maize for three months, giving 255,000 drought-affected people across the country the food and nutritional assistance they need. A record 45 million Southern Africans are food insecure as the region enters the peak of the lean season (January-March 2020). Between October 2019 and March 2020, an estimated 430,000 people are facing severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3+) and require urgent humanitarian action. More than 4.34 million people in rural Zimbabwe are acutely food insecure facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse from February-June 2020. That is equivalent to 45% of the country’s rural population. This includes over 1.04 million people facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity, with Hwange, Kariba and Binga districts being the most vulnerable. According to the results of the IPC, around 26% of Lesotho’s population (380,000 people) are facing high food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) and above from July to September 2020 and require urgent humanitarian action. This includes around 33,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 350,000 people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). In the current period, seven districts are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3) with the exception of Butha-Buthe, Leribe and Berea, where around 560,000 people are classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and require support to maintain their livelihoods. Between October 2020 and March 2021, Zambia’s food security situation is expected to deteriorate, as this coincides with the lean season, when more households will rely on the market for food. It is projected that about 1.98 million people (29% of the analysed population) will be facing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. By the end of the year, severe food insecurity was affecting 13.6 million people across 11 countries, and this will rise during the lean season (January to March 2021). In the Grand Sud of Madagascar, over 900,000 people faced severe food insecurity from October to December due to back-to-back droughts, compounded by COVID-19 and displacements due to the growing insecurity related to cattle raiding. Hunger will increase and affect 1.14 million from January to April 2021. In Mozambique, conflict in Cabo Delgado Province—which had displaced more than 500,000 people by end-October—and drought in the semi-arid southern and central areas of the country drove Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of food insecurity. In Zimbabwe, 2.6 million people were severely food insecure from October to December 2020 due to the prevailing economic situation and erratic rainfall, and 3.4 million people are projected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) from January to March 2021. Without the humanitarian assistance delivered in Zimbabwe in 2020, these figures would be much higher, according to the IPC analysis. According to the acute food insecurity analysis update in Zambia for the February-March 2021 projection period, an estimated 1.73 million people (25% of the analysed population) are likely to face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). This includes around 1.5 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and around 240,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), who will require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods. Around 27.3 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), making the central African country the host of the highest number of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in the world. Angola has been experiencing episodes of drought since December last year with below average rainfall in the provinces of Cuanza Sul, Benguela, Huambo, Namibe and Huíla. The situation is not expected to improve in the coming months in the absence of above average rainfall. Since the beginning of March 2021, Angolans living in the border provinces of Cunene and Huila are crossing into Namibia at illegal entry points in Omusati and Ohangwena regions in search of food, water, medical services and employment opportunities. The regional councils (local authorities) have recorded altogether 894 people in Omusati and Kunene regions who have crossed into Namibia in search of food. Mozambique: In the 16 analysis units analysed in Cabo Delgado Province, in total, it is estimated that about 75,000 children aged 6-59 months are suffering and are likely to suffer from acute malnutrition in the next 12 months and, consequently, need and will need treatment. In terms of severity of the situation, for the period October 2020 to March 2021, corresponding to the season when the survey was conducted (February 2021), eight districts and two IDP centres were classified in Alert (IPC AMN Phase 2), five districts and one IDP centre were classified in Acceptable (IPC AMN Phase 1). Projection analyses of the situation indicate, that for the period April to September 2021, in districts with limited or no humanitarian access, by the end of the projection period, the situation is likely to deteriorate to Critical (IPC AMN Phase 4) in one district, to Serious (IPC AMN Phase 3) in three districts, and to Alert in four districts. Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes are widespread across much of southern Madagascar, with some households experiencing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and worst-affected households in Ambovombe and Amboasary experiencing Catastrophe ((IPC Phase 5). Minimal seasonal improvement in food access is expected in southern Madagascar due to the expected limited harvest and associated income-earning opportunities. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes with some households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) are expected to persist through at least September. Conflict continues at relatively high levels in Cabo Delgado Mozambique and parts of the DRCongo. According to OCHA, as of April, over 732,000 people were displaced in Cabo Delgado. In Kasai, DRCongo, in March, about 41,000 were displaced due to conflict. Additionally, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, recent conflict has resulted in the government’s declaration of martial law. Conflict in DRC and Mozambique has disrupted agricultural and most typical livelihood activities with minimal seasonal improvements expected with the harvest. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected in these areas through at least September. As the harvest continues across most of the region, most households, including the poor, are consuming foods from their own production. Overall, households in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Lesotho, and most parts of Mozambique are anticipated to experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Minimal (IPC Phase 1) through at least September. In areas where Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes, while the harvest is expected to facilitate improved food access, household income will most likely remain below average. Millions of people in southern Angola are facing an existential threat as drought aggravated by climate change continues to ravage the region, Amnesty International said today. The organization highlighted how the creation of commercial cattle ranches on community land has driven pastoralist communities from their land since the end of the civil war in 2002 - a shift which left huge sections of the population food insecure and paved the way for a humanitarian crisis as the acute drought persists for over three years when drought struck over three years ago. As food and water grow increasingly scarce, thousands have fled their homes and sought refuge in neighbouring Namibia. The latest IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis results indicate that between July and September 2021, about 1.18 million people in Zambia are facing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Flooding, high maize prices, and pests drive the country’s acute food insecurity despite a good harvest. The highly food insecure population requires urgent humanitarian assistance to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. The situation has particularly deteriorated in the Western province, where five districts were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Over 1 million people in Malawi are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase between July and September 2021. Despite Malawi’s record high maize production of 46% above the five-year average, some pockets in these districts and cities experienced severe dry spells and earlier than normal tailing of rainfall. This led to localized production shortfalls coupled with the impact of COVID-19 on remittances, petty trade and self-employment activities. The population experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity require urgent action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. Around 3.6 million people are classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2), experiencing a mild level of food insecurity, while 14.1 million people are food secure-- Minimal (IPC Phase 1). All the four urban zones analyzed (Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mzuzu, Zomba) are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) while the rural areas are in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) – 16 areas out of the 28 analyzed - or in IPC Phase 1 (none/minimal). The worst drought in the last 40 years and rising food prices have resulted in high acute food insecurity in the Cunene, Huila and Namibe provinces of South-Western Angola. An IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis of 17 municipalities of Southern Angola found that, between July and September 2021, around 1.32 million people (49% of the analysed population) have experienced high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), of which 38% are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 12% in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). These people face difficulties in accessing food or are only able to meet the minimum food requirements through crisis and/or emergency coping strategies. Between October 2021 and March 2022, the number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above is expected to rise to around 1.58 million people (58% of the analysed population), of which 42% are likely in IPC Phase 3 and 15% in IPC Phase 4. Three of the municipalities are also expected to move to a worse phase (Chicomba, Moçâmedes and Tômbua). Around 27 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) between September and December 2021, of which around 6.1 million people are experiencing critical levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 4). The country has the largest number of highly food insecure people in the world. This food insecurity is a result of a combination of conflict, economic decline, high food prices and the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis issued in September 2021 and covering the period from July to September 2021, about 1.18 million people in Zambia were facing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) with 77,938 people being most affected in Luapula, Lusaka and Western provinces. For the current period (November 2021 to March 2022), which coincides with the lean season, approximately 1.9 million people are estimated to be in high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) in the urban and rural areas of Mozambique that were analysed, and are in need of humanitarian assistance. Of these, 71% (1.32 million people) are in the four provinces of Cabo Delgado, Niassa, Nampula and Zambézia, where many of the country’s Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are concentrated. One district of Tete (Changara), one of Manica (Tambara) and three of Gaza (Chibuto, Mabalane and Guijá) are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). An estimated 7.3 million people in Angola are facing food and nutrition insecurity due to climate shocks. An estimated 3.9 million children are in need of assistance. Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) admissions among children 6 to 59 months at mid-year 2021 have already exceeded the 2020 total caseload. An estimated 1.2 million people are facing water scarcity as a direct consequence of the drought and have had their water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions compromised by COVID-19. Malawi: In the current period of November 2021 to December 2021, about 1.4 million people (7% of the population) are estimated to be experiencing Crisis levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) and require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. Around 4.4 million people are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) while 13.1 million people are food secure (IPC Phase 1). Out of all rural districts, district towns and cities analysed, 26 areas are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) while six are classified in IPC Phase 1 (Minimal). No areas are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Out of the 1.4 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), around 186,000 are from urban areas (Mzuzu, Lilongwe, Zomba and Blantyre cities), representing 8% of the urban population, whilst the remaining 1.2 million people are from the rural areas and the Bomas, representing 7% of the rural and Boma population. Overall, there is concern for the 2021/22 season as rainfall through mid-December has been significantly below average across Madagascar, Malawi, central and northern Mozambique, and northwestern Zimbabwe. Across these areas, drought conditions are ongoing to start the season. Land preparation activities are delayed, and planting has yet to begin across many areas as of November. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are ongoing across rainfall deficit areas and areas of northern Mozambique and eastern DRC impacted by continued conflict. Humanitarian assistance in southern Madagascar and Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique is improving household food consumption, where Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) and Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes are ongoing, respectively. Between December 2021 and March 2022, around 336,000 people (29% of the population in Eswatini) are estimated to be facing high acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 Crisis or above) and require urgent humanitarian assistance. Of this population, 286,000 people are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 50,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). An additional 376,000 are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) and require livelihood support. Compared to the October 2021 - March 2022 projection period from the August 2021 analysis, this update shows a slight deterioration, with a slight increase in the food insecure population in IPC Phase 3 or above in all livelihood zones except for Highveld Cattle and Maize, Timber Highlands and Moist Middleveld, with the latter two having 47% of their households having food stocks lasting more than six months. This update has seen the population projected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above increase by 19,000 people. Tanzania: For the current period of analysis (November 2021 - April 2022), about 437,000 people, representing 13% of an analysed population of 3.4 million, are estimated to be experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). Overall, an estimated 22,000 people (1% of the population analysed) are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and around 415,000 people (12% of the population analysed) in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Around 785,000 people (23% of the population analysed) are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed). Amongst the 14 councils of Tanzania analysed (12 district councils [DCs] and the rural parts of two town councils [TCs]), four councils (Handeni DC, Longido, Mkinga, and Monduli) are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), with 20% to 30% of their population experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (Phase 3 or above). The rest of the councils are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed). Approximately 5.4 million people in Malawi living in rural and secondary urban centres are facing Moderate or Severe chronic food insecurity (IPC CFI Levels 3 and 4) due to abject poverty and recurrent shocks, among other drivers. The February Malawi IPC Chronic Food Insecurity (CFI) analysis found that an additional estimated 4.4 million people face Mild food insecurity, whilst approximately 6.9 million people face No/Minimal chronic food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity in Malawi, where over 70% of the population of about 19.1 million people is living below the international poverty line of $1.90/day, is driven by abject poverty, recurrent shocks, poor policies and implementation as well as reliance on weak livelihood strategies.',\n",

Initially reported in 17 health districts spanning seven out of eight regions, the outbreak has now spread to three additional health districts, namely Agadez, Takieta and Tchirozerine, with an upward trend over time. During epidemiological week 42 (ending 22 October 2023), a total of 98 new suspected diphtheria cases, including two deaths (CFR 2.0%), were reported making a 64.3% increase in cases, compared to the 35 cases reported in epidemiological week 41. From 17 July to 23 October 2023, a cumulative total of 1,690 suspected cases were reported in 20 health districts, resulting in 75 deaths (CFR 4.4%). More than 80% (n=1,371) of cases were reported from three health districts, including Matameye (58%, n=973), Magaria (15%, n=260), and Tanout (8%, n=138). Of the 75 recorded deaths, 22.7% (n=17) were reported from Matameye, followed by Zinder (21.3%, n=16), Tanout (12.0%, n=9), Magaria (9.3%, n=7), Aderbissinat (8%, n=6), and Gouree (6.6%, n=5). On 20 October 2023, the Government of Niger, through the Ministry of Public Health, Population and Social Affairs, declared a diphtheria outbreak. The first case was registered on 17 July 2023. As of 02 November, all eight regions of the country have notified at least 1 case of diphtheria. A total of 1,838 suspected cases of diphtheria, including 91 deaths (lethality: 5%), have been reported. The regions of Zinder (1,578 cases) and Agadez (132 cases) are the most impacted, contributing to 86% and 7% of the total caseload, respectively. 47% of positive cases are among children aged 5 to 14 years, 22% of positive cases are aged 12 to 59 months, 2.5% of positive cases are less than 1 year old and about 28.5% are aged 15 and above.',\n",

A national response plan was immediately developed, and the ministry held an emergency meeting on October 23, 2023, to ask the support of all its partners. Following the meeting, the NS received a formal letter requesting support. Humanitarian partners have undertaken a vaccination campaign against diphtheria. The campaign aims to cover 800,000 children under 14 years old for the first round, in the Zinder region in the east-central part of the country, the epicentre of the epidemic. Efforts are underway to mobilize resources to cover the entire target, which is estimated at 4 million in that region. This year, prior to the current campaign, technical and logistical support was provided for vaccination response in the Kantché and Amsoudou health districts (Zinder region).

Food stocks and non-food items such as mats, children’s learning materials and clothing were also damaged or destroyed. Humanitarian partners conducted a rapid assessment on 3 August, as well as relocated 96 shelters to dry land and deployed 20 trucks of sand to reinforce shelters and fill sandbags to hold back the flood waters. The Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency warned that severe flooding would affect most parts of the country throughout August and September. Partners have been prepositioning food and other items to mitigate the effects of the rainy season in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. Several camps, such as the one flooded in Bama town, started as spontaneous settlements in flood-prone areas. Humanitarian partners are advocating for land to be allocated to relocate some of these camps. On 6 October 2020, flood levels at the hydrological stations monitored in Niamey (Niger Republic) and Malan Ville (Benin Republic) reached the red alert zone due to the intensity of the torrential rainfall and caused flooding in Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto, and Zamfara state (amongst other states) affecting 91,254 people or 15,209 households. The situation in Kebbi – the country's biggest rice-producing state – is especially dire, as vast farmlands are completely submerged due to the most recent rains. Meanwhile in Jigawa state, a total of 18 out of 27 Local Government Areas (LGA)s have been affected, with Gwaram, Birnin Kudu, Kirikasamma, and Gumel as the worst hit. Wide swaths of farmlands have been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of Naira. Kwara State is also concerning as more than 5,000 households have been affected. The government estimates damage worth N10bn have been incurred. Since September to date, torrential rainfall, river floods and flash floods have cumulatively impacted 192,594 people across Nigeria. Some 826 injuries and 155 fatalities have so far been recorded and 24,134 people are reported to be displaced. Most of those affected are children. Wide swaths of farmlands have also been washed away with a loss of crops amounting to billions of naira. These floods have so far impacted 22 states in the country’s six geo-political zones: North West (4 state), North Central (4 states), North East (4 state), South East (4 states), South-South (3 states) and South West (3 state). This earlier flooding had weakened Nigeria’s water supply and road infrastructure, killing dozens and leading to disease outbreaks.\",\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'On 7 October 2023 at around 11.00 local time, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck 40km west of Herat City in Herat Province, western Afghanistan. Several aftershocks have occurred since, with the initial quake felt in neighbouring Badghis and Farah provinces. Initial assessments indicate that as many as 100 people have been killed across eight villages in Zindajan Province, Herat Province – Mahal Wardkah (20), Dasht Hows (15), Bahadorzai (14), Zoryan (13), Koshkak (12), Sar Boland (11), Sanjab (8), and Hilalzai (7), with a further 500 people injured. Aftershocks continue to be felt two days after a 6.3 magnitude earthquake rocked Herat Province, western Afghanistan. To date, it is estimated 12,110 people (1,730 families) have been affected by the earthquake across five districts of Herat Province — Gulran (95 families), Injil (150 families), Khosan (60 families), Kushk (Robat-e-Sangai) (30 families) and Zindajan (1,395 families). The number of affected households is expected to rise as assessments are continuing in Gulran, Injil, Khosan and Kushk districts. The epicentre of the earthquake – Zindajan district – is the worst-affected area with 1,294 deaths, 1,688 injuries and 100 percent of homes destroyed. A further 485 people (191 men and 294 women) are reported to be missing. An aftershock of 5.1 M has been recorded in the affected area (37 km north-northwest of Herat City) on 10 October at 13.30 UTC. A new 6.3 M earthquake at a depth of 9 km, followed by two aftershocks of 5 M and 4.1 M, hit Herat Province on 11 October at 00:41 UTC (05:11 local time). The 6.3 M earthquake was located in Zinda Jan District, 27 km northwest of Herat City and at 14 km south-east of the 6.3 M earthquake that occurred on 7 October that caused more than 2,400 fatalities, as of 10 October. According to USGS, approximately 4,000 people were exposed to severe shaking and 1,273 million people were exposed to strong and very strong shaking. Media reports, as of 11 October, 80 injured people that have been hospitalized while rescue operation are still ongoing throughout the region for the 11 October earthquake. After the recent 6.3 M earthquake that occurred on 11 October in Herat Province, one person died and 140 people have been injured, all in Herat City and Injil District, as reported by UN OCHA. Several villages across the Districts of Gulran, Injil and Kush sustained damage following the earthquake. In addition, following previous seismic events since 7 October, at least 2,400 people have died, several hundred are reported missing, 1,714 houses have been destroyed, and 11,066 people have been affected across four districts. According to UNITAR-UNOSAT, 15 settlements have been destroyed, three severely affected and 38 moderately affected. To date, 1,384 people (759 females and 625 males) are reported to have been killed and 1,853 people injured (1,137 females and 716 males) by the earthquakes. Women and children are overly represented within reported casualties. Assessments completed to date indicate that 3,067 homes have been affected across Zindajan, Injil, Kushk / Rabat-e-Sangai, Ghulan, Herat and Khosan districts, including 2,499 which have been completely destroyed, 363 which have been severely damaged and 250 which have been moderately damaged. More than three quarters of homes destroyed are located in two districts – Zinjadin (1,353) and Injil districts (586). Additionally, 21,300 buildings are estimated to have sustained damage. On 15 October, areas north-east of Herat City were hit by a 6.3 magnitude earthquake, the third in a week to strike communities in Herat Province. Two people were reportedly killed and more than 150 people injured. Casualty numbers are not expected to rise significantly as many people are already living in the open out of fear their homes will collapse. Humanitarian facilities, residences and office spaces have sustained damage of varying severity, with engineering assessments a critical priority to differentiate between cosmetic and structural damage, and to allow traumatized residents to return to their homes. To date, 43,395 people (7,165 families) are reported to have been directly affected by the recent earthquakes across Injil (23,053 people), Kushk / Rabat-e-Sangai (8,541 people), Zindajan (7,523 people), Gulran (3,428 people), Herat (717 people) and Kohsan (133 people) districts. Injil is the worst affected district, accounting for 53 per cent of people affected. More than 3,330 homes are also reported to have been completely destroyed – the majority in Zindajan district – 2,137 homes severely damaged, and 1,697 homes moderately damaged. A scale-up of response activities is underway to provide humanitarian support to communities in Herat Province, Western Afghanistan in the aftermath of a sequence of shallow, powerful earthquakes with magnitudes exceeding 6.0, accompanied by recurring aftershocks since 7 October 2023. Assessments completed to date indicate that more than 21,500 homes have been completely destroyed (8,429) – mostly in Herat, Injil and Zindajan districts – and severely damaged (17,088) in the earthquakes, affecting around 154,000 people. With temperatures already dropping ahead of the onset of winter, affected communities will also be in need of sustainable solutions to withstand harsh conditions with urgently needed assistance to restore and reconstruct homes and shelters, and reestablish livelihoods. Latest assessments show that the first two earthquakes on 7 and 11 October left 1,480 people dead and 1,950 wounded, with available satellite imagery indicating that 513 villages were impacted, and assessments ongoing. To date, nearly 43,400 people across six districts are reported to be directly affected by the recent earthquakes, with Injil and Zindajan districts worst affected. More than half of all earthquake-affected people are in Injil, with the majority of the more than 3,330 destroyed homes assessed to date located in Zindajan. Schools, health facilities, and other infrastructure also impacted by the earthquakes, with 21,300 buildings estimated to have sustained damage. Following the earthquakes, families are living in the open, in makeshift shelters, or in informal settlement sites, leaving them vulnerable to weather, health and other protection hazards. The recent series of earthquakes has left a profound impact on a substantial number of families and individuals in the affected districts. A total of 48,347 families, comprising 275,256 people, were directly affected by these seismic events. The 382 villages are situated in the districts of Herat, Injil, Kushk, Zindajan, Gulran, Guzara, Ghoryan, Karukh, and Kohsan in Herat Province. The devastation caused by these earthquakes has been substantial, with 10,002 houses completely destroyed, 20,430 houses with severe damage, and 17,588 houses with moderate damage. As a result, a significant portion of the affected population, approximately 37,139 families, are now forced to live in makeshift tents and open spaces, while 1,268 families reside in informal settlements, and another 8,801 families have resorted to tent shelters as temporary solutions. More than two months on from the first of three devastating 6.3 magnitude earthquakes in Herat Province, western Afghanistan, humanitarian actors have reached 266,800 affected people with direct assistance. Assistance provided to affected communities to date includes emergency shelter (tents) to 16,169 households, US $5.1 million in multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA) to 19,652 households—almost 5,961 received the full MPCA package ($340 per household) and 4,310 the half MPCA package ($170). Additionally, 21,017 families have received non-food items, 13,101 families winter blankets and 11,782 families shelter repair kits. Emergency food assistance has also been provided to 110,033 people, livestock support to 853 people, nutritious foods to almost 64,512 boys and girls under five years old and essential primary healthcare to 60,256 people. Under protection, dignity kits have been provided to more than 11,822 women and girls, child-friendly space activities to 9,494 children and psycho-social support to 14,045 individuals, among other activities. One-third of all earthquakes affected people are in Injil, with more than 3,330 destroyed homes located in Zindajan. Approximately 37,139 families now reside in makeshift tents, open spaces, damaged shelters, 8,801 families are in tents and 1,268 families are residing in informal settlements. Notable needs for persons with specific needs, including 17,358 pregnant women, 17,146 infants, 3,976 individuals living with severe disabilities, 3,207 vulnerable elderly families, 3,139 unaccompanied children, 6,806 female headed households and 3,176 people chronically ill have been identified. These events have also resulted in extensive damage to vital water and sanitation facilities. The field data collection exercise for the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) for the Herat Earthquake was undertaken during the month. UNICEF lead the Education and WASH sectors as well as provided technical support in the Health and Nutrition sector. Preliminary results from the PDNA highlight that the most affected sectors in terms of aggregate damage and loss are housing, education, agriculture, livestock and minor irrigation, and transportation. The most affected districts include Herat, Injil, and Zindajan. Reconstruction and recovery needs for the nine assessed districts are estimated at US$ 383.9 million, with needs for one year, two to three years, and over three to five years estimated at US$ 154.5 million, US$ 190 million, and US$ 39.3 million, respectively. Although 85 days have passed since the earthquakes, many survivors and victims still live in makeshift tents and temporary shelters, with the situation remaining precarious. On December 28, a mild earthquake was reported in Herat Province. Most of the displaced individuals are grappling with various health issues, including trauma and mental health disorders. WHO and Health Cluster partners have been expanding efforts to provide healthcare assistance to the 220,000 affected individuals, including 1,900 female-headed households. By the end of December 2023, 102,655 individuals were provided with humanitarian health assistance. Despite these efforts, a significant funding gap persists. The Health Cluster has appealed for US$12.7 million to sustain these initiatives through March 2024, but only US$5.2 million has been received thus far. Following the earthquakes of 7 October 2023, the IFRC Secretariat dispatched emergency shelter and household items, allocated CHF 750,000 from the IFRC Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the ARCS immediate response. Additionally, the Emergency Appeal MDRAF007 was relaunched to incorporate immediate and recovery needs arising from the earthquakes. The latest revision of the Emergency Appeal includes a funding requirement of CHF 9 million for the Herat earthquake response. This response is among several others supported by the IFRC in the context of multiple humanitarian crises affecting Afghanistan.',\n",

Rural populations in Ali Sabieh, Arta, Obock, Tadjourah and Dikhil are particularly exposed to extreme deprivation and no longer able to cope due to lack of access to main basic services as water, health, and education. Malnutrition rates are almost double from last year in at least one health center visited by DG ECHO in May 2022. Communities report the depletion of livestock assets, loss of body mass index, and lack of milk production followed by death of livestock. According to the latest IPC, approximately 13% of the population (132,000 people) is facing acute food insecurity (IPC3) and is in need of immediate assistance. Projections indicate an increase in food insecurity to 16% of the population by December 2022. IPC projections for July to December 2022 indicate an increase in the number of acutely food insecure people, likely reaching 192,168 people, representing 16% of analysed population (1.2 million people, which is about the entire country). The number of people in emergency (IPC 4) will likely increase 12,390 people, a 250% rise from the current numbers, while the 179,778 people could be in crisis (IPC 3). Current IPC analysis for the period of March to June 2022, highlight that approximately 132,000 people, representing 11% of the analysed population (of nearly 1.2 million people), are estimated to be acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 3 and 4). More precisely, an estimated 5,000 people (less than one percent of the population analysed) are estimated to already be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and approximately 127,000 people (11% of the population analysed) are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), about 285,000 people are estimated to face severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 [Crisis] and IPC Phase 4 [Emergency]) in the July‑December 2023 period. This figure, which includes about 185,000 people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 100,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), amounts to about one‑quarter of the country’s population and it is almost 50 percent higher on a yearly basis. The high prevalence and severity of acute food insecurity and the deterioration of the food security situation are mainly due to the lingering impact of a prolonged and severe drought, which affected livelihoods between late 2020 and early 2023, and resulted in a reduction of livestock numbers by about 50 percent due to widespread deaths, severely constraining incomes and availability of livestock products for pastoralist households.',\n",

According to media reports, during the last 48 hours, eight deaths and several thousand have been displaced from Kerala, Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra. About 440 families in Maldives and 293 families in Sri Lanka also reported affected. Heavy rain and strong winds are expected also across southeastern Pakistan. Tropical Cyclone Tauktae made landfall as a category 3 cyclone on the southern coast of Gujarat on the night of 17 May. Before making landfall, Tauktae brushed India’s west coast over the weekend, causing damage in the states of Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra. Authorities in affected states evacuated more than 200,000 people from low-lying areas near the coast, including COVID-19 patients in healthcare facilities. In Gujarat, vaccinations were suspended for two days to facilitate evacuations. More than 80 disaster management teams have been deployed to assist district authorities with preparedness and response measures. The Indian navy conducted rescue operations off the coast of Mumbai to save people from drifting vessels. While assessments in Gujarat are ongoing, early reports from the states of Kerala, Karnataka and Maharashtra indicate that at least 23 people have died, and over 3,100 houses have been damaged or destroyed, including at least seven primary health centers. The Inter-Agency Group of Gujarat, a coalition of humanitarian agencies supported by UNICEF, is engaging with the Government of Gujarat for rapid needs assessments and to support the Government-led response.

Over 200 rivers overflowed, with Northern Moravia, particularly Jeseník, Opava, and Ostrava, among the hardest-hit areas. The rain totals in parts of Jeseník exceeded 500 mm (20 inches), surpassing previous flood records. Roads, railways, and bridges suffered extensive damage, especially in Ostrava, where train services were suspended. These regions experienced severe flooding, leading to the destruction of homes and infrastructure. Thousands of people were evacuated, and approximately 250,000 were left without electricity. The situation remains critical in parts of the South Bohemian Region, where ongoing threats of further flooding persist. As of 19 September, five fatalities were reported, along with widespread displacement of about 10,000 residents. Heavy rains brought by Storm Boris have caused severe flooding in southwestern Poland, particularly affecting the voivodeships of Dolnoslaskie, Opolskie, Slaskie, and Malopolskie. Rivers like the Morawka have overflowed, and some dams have collapsed, leading to widespread flooding. On 16 September, the Council of Ministers declared a \"state of natural disaster\" for a period of 30 days in parts of the Lower Silesian, Opole, and Silesian voivodeships. As of 19 September 2024, seven people have been confirmed dead due to the flooding. The Prime Minister\\'s Office reported that the disaster has directly affected 57,000 people, with 6,544 residents evacuated as waters continue to rise. The 2024 Central European floods in Romania were triggered by Storm Boris, which brought torrential rains to the counties of Galați and Vaslui on 14 September. In less than 24 hours, over 150 mm of rainfall per square meter caused ash floods in several areas. Galați was the hardest hit, with flood waters reaching depths of 1.5 to 2 meters in the localities of Cudalbi, Cuza-Vodă, Pechea, Slobozia-Conachi, Tudor Vladimirescu, and Costache Negri. In Vaslui, the southern localities of Zorleni, Grivița, and Trestiana were most affected. The floods caused widespread destruction, severely damaging infrastructure such as roads, bridges, power systems, and schools. More than 6,000 homes were either damaged or destroyed across both counties. Around 400 people remain displaced and are currently being sheltered in temporary housing provided by authorities. Tragically, seven deaths have been confirmed. Heavy rainfall has been affecting central Bosnia and Herzegovina (in particular the Herzegovina-Neretva canton, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) since 3 October in the evening (UTC), causing severe floods and flash floods and triggering landslides that have resulted in casualties and damage.

Forecasts indicate below-average to average precipitation for the remaining weeks of the spring wet season. Along with cumulative precipitation deficits, the below-average forecast is reflective of a low frequency of storms entering the region, increasing the risk for extended periods of dryness that could impact agricultural production. The intense drought between April and September is expected to further aggravate the already poor malnutrition status within the 20 affected provinces, and the impact may extend to December.

According to media reports, 100 people were evacuated in Kayin State and 3,000 people affected. Initial reports indicated that some 3,000 people have reportedly been affected, with 100 households evacuated from their homes in Hlaingbwe Township in Kayin State. In addition, more than 1,400 people in several wards in Myawaddy Town in Kayin State were evacuated to 10 relief camps on 26 July. Additional people, whose exact number could not be ascertained, have also been affected in several townships in Mon State, including in Mawlamyine and Ye. In Rakhine, initial reports indicated that Kalar Chaung Monastery displacement site, hosting about 1,000 IDPs in Mrauk-U Township has been flooded on 25 July. This has affected approximately 24 out of 142 shelters within the displacement site. In Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung townships, over 600 households in several villages have been affected, while roads connecting communities have been blocked and power supply disrupted in Thandwe Township since 26 July; water levels on the roads have reached up to nine feet. Some 200 households in the township’s affected areas have been evacuated to safer locations by local volunteers; they are expected to return to their places of origin soon. In Kyaukpyu Township, Kyauk Ta Lone IDP camp, at least 27 families have had their temporary shelter damaged, and dozens of sanitation facilities damaged or destroyed due to the floods. The affected people are taking refuge in the higher sections of the camp, hosted by relatives. Operational partners are currently collaborating with local aid groups and volunteers to better understand the situation and collect information on people’s needs. According to multiple sources, many people in affected locations and other areas where precipitation had been forecasted need support with evacuation. Those who have been evacuated or otherwise affected by floods require assistance in food, emergency shelter, health care and medical supplies, according to initial reports. Local volunteers have managed to evacuate the affected people and have provided initial assistance in terms of food and WASH as well as some COVID-19 awareness raising activities. The response, however, is likely to be impacted by access limitations, including those related to the current COVID-19 prevention measures. As of mid-August, an estimated 125,000 people have been affected by flooding, mainly in Kachin, Kayin, Mon, Rakhine and eastern areas of Shan states as well as in Mandalay and Tanintharyi regions, according to local partners. In Kachin State, flash floods and a landslide on 12 August reportedly destroyed at least 15 shelters in Maga Yang camp in Waingmaw Township, which hosts about 1,600 internally displaced people (IDP); one civilian was reportedly killed during the floods. Similarly, several townships in eastern areas of Shan State experienced flash floods and landslides between 11 and 18 August. A local community, three temporary displacement sites and a relocation site in Muse Township, which hosts around 350 displaced families have been affected. Similar incidents took place in Mogoke Township of Mandalay Region in the second week of August, with floods and landslides reportedly killing four persons, including a child, and washing away a number of houses. In Rakhine State, at least 10 villages in Toungup Township have been flooded due to heavy rains on 6 August, affecting some 1,300 houses, a hospital and paddy fields, according to local partners. Heavy rains and floods have further aggravated an already extremely challenging situation in the south-eastern parts of the country. In Kayin State, at least five townships have been affected. Another nine townships were affected by floods in Mon State, while in Tanintharyi Region, at least three townships have been affected. Local humanitarian actors, volunteers and communities responded to the needs of affected families, including with organizing temporary shelter for those who had to be evacuated to safer areas. The floods have also damaged crops, and according to initial assessments, at least 2,000 acres of paddy fields in Kyainseikgyi Township in Kayin State have been impacted, with farmers facing difficulties with seeds and expenses to cover replanting of the paddy. An additional 40,000 cultivated land has been affected across different states and regions, according to partners. The monsoon weather system is strong and active, and on 24 August, Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) forecast predicted water levels may exceed the danger level of major rivers and river dams such as Ayeyarwady River and Sittoung River that are currently in critical situation and could have the ability to impact the most at-risk areas. As of 25 August, the Thanlwin River has exceeded the danger zone. There are concerns that the weather system, fluvial floods, and flash floods could cause damage in communities across several regions, particularly in Shan (East), Kayin, Mon, Rakhine, Tanintharyi, Magway, Mandalay, Kachin, Sagaing and Chin regions. Some of these areas have experienced previous devastation by the flood in 2015 and 2017. It is estimated more than 1.6 million vulnerable people are likely to be impacted by sessional monsoon related disasters. DMH forecasts that the monsoon season will continue until October with medium to heavy rainfall and it is likely that Myanmar will experience new floods, in addition to probable increased severity impacts.',\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'On 25 July 2020, a bulk carrier vessel, MV Wakashio, ran aground on the reef of Point d’Esny, off the coast of Mauritius. The vessel was carrying nearly 4,200 metric tons (MT) of fuel, including low-sulphur fuel oil (3,894 MT), diesel (207 MT) and lubricant oil (90 MT). The ship is located near ecologically sensitive and important areas, including the Point d’Esny Wetlands, Ile aux Aigrettes Nature Reserve, Blue Bay Marine Area, Mahebourg Fishing Reserves, barachois (coastal lagoons) and mangroves. The Point d’Esny Wetlands are designated as a site of international importance under the Convention on Wetlands (‘Ramsar Convention’). The Nagashiki Shipping Co. Ltd, which owns and manages the vessel, told media in an emailed statement that “due to bad weather and constant pounding over the past few days, the starboard side bunker tanker has been breached and an amount of fuel oil has escaped into the sea.” Preliminary satellite analysis conducted by UNOSAT found that the shipwreck location was approximately 2 kilometres from the shore at Point d’Esny and that 0.23km2 oil spill was observed by 6 August. Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has declared a “state of environmental emergency” and said that the sinking of the boat “represents a danger” for the people of Mauritius. The country’s approximately 1.3 million inhabitants rely heavily on tourism, which has already been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Cracks on the hull of MV Wakashio have continued to worsen and there remains a high likelihood that the bulk carrier will break-up. There are also concerns regarding the impact the oil spill will have on Mauritius’ unique ecosystems, including Blue Bay Marine Park, Pointe d’Esny Wetland and Ile aux Aigrettes Nature Reserve and wildlife. Reports indicate that the oil is likely to drift northwards, with sightings as far north as Bambous Virieux. Many people in the affected areas rely on fishing for their livelihoods, which will be impacted by the oil spill. Others rely on the tourism industry which was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and now must contend with a second significant setback.',\n",

Although the cause of the fire incident remains unknown as no official reports have been released by the government, however, the current season, wind intensity and direction as well as the type of materials used for the settlement and density of shelters, have been key contributing factors as to why the fire had spread rapidly and engulfed its surrounding areas.

The deluge caused extensive damage, overwhelming local capacities and necessitating immediate humanitarian intervention. Just one day later, the communities of Duhu, Mayowandu, Kirchinga, Maiwandu, Jahili, Kokohu, Lumadu, Zhau, Pallam, Kwambula, Shuware, and Shuwa in Madagali Local Government Area were struck by another catastrophic flood, triggered by the upstream flow of waters from the Cameroonian highlands. This secondary flooding event exacerbated the already dire situation, compounding the devastation and further straining local resources. According to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), the floodwaters rose with alarming speed, catching residents off guard and resulting in the widespread destruction of homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods. The disaster has affected 12,583 individuals, displaced 2,079 households, and caused the destruction of 298 buildings, 203 farmlands, and 509 livestock. The immediate humanitarian needs include shelter, food, non-food items, medical assistance, and access to clean water. Heavy rainfall has been affecting northern Nigeria since 20 August, causing floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. According to International Rescue Committee (IRC), as of 2 September, at least 170 people died, 205,338 have been displaced, 515,794 have been affected, and 76,667 houses have been damaged across 28 out of 36 states, including Bauchi, Zamfara, Sokoto, Niger, and Jigawa states as the most impacted. Heavy rainfall continues to affect north-eastern Nigeria, causing floods and the Alau Dam overflowing, and resulting in casualties and damage. On 10 September, according to media, the overflow of the Alau Dam, approximately 15 km southwest of Maiduguri city, in Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria, flooded Maiduguri. Over 239,000 people have been affected and at least 50,000 people have been displaced across Fori, Galtimari, Gwange and Bulabulin areas. Several structures have been destroyed, including one hospital and one zoo. According to media, as of 12 September, the overflow of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River occurred on 10 September, and flooded Maiduguri city, in Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria. At least 30 people died, more than 414,000 have been displaced, approximately 1 million people have been affected, and thousands of houses and structures have been destroyed. More than 414,000 people are affected by floods in Borno State, with some 37 deaths and 58 people injured reported. Access to hospitals and markets and other critical infrastructure remains limited. Schools are closed with some serving as temporary relocation sites. Two major bridges in Maiduguri (Lagos Street Bridge and Gwange Bridge) have partially collapsed. Over 300,000 people have been registered in at least 26 relocation sites, as of 14 September, according to the Borno State Government’s Emergency Operations Centre. Up to 30 sites have been set up and registration is ongoing. The flood situation across Nigeria has become a major humanitarian crisis, with 31 states and 180 local government areas (LGAs) severely affected. Over 1,083,141 individuals have been impacted by the relentless rains, leading to widespread displacement, loss of lives, and destruction of homes and livelihoods. The floods have left 641,598 persons displaced, 285 people dead, and 2,504 injured. Houses, farmlands, and critical infrastructure have been devastated, with 98,242 homes affected. Between July and September 2024, 29 states across the nation experienced exceptionally high rainfall, compounded by the collapse of the Alau Dam in the Maiduguri area of Borno State, which worsened the already dire humanitarian situation, leading to widespread flooding, the collapse of bridges, closure of schools, and restricted access to hospitals and markets. The resulting devastation has caused extensive damage to homes, infrastructure, crops, and shelters, critically disrupting livelihoods and displacing thousands of households. The latest report by UNOCHA confirms that at least one million people have been affected, with 311 lives lost and more than 3,174 injured. A total of 390,000 people have been displaced, forced to flee with only the belongings they could carry, but now finding themselves in deplorable conditions, without sufficient safeguards and exposed to heightened protection risks. Roughly 245,500 people are living in collective shelters or internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, with 2,867 communities impacted across 29 states. Over 6,490,307 square metres (649.0307 hectares) of farmland have been destroyed by the floods, foreshadowing severe humanitarian consequences. Floodwaters have receded in MMC and Jere LGAs two weeks after the 9 September collapse of the Alau Dam in Borno’s Konduga LGA. As a result, and in response to ongoing efforts to reduce and consolidate temporary relocation sites, the number of people displaced by flooding has reduced from about 400,000 people housed in 36 sites at the height of the crisis to 150,000 people in 22 sites, as of 24 September. Almost four weeks after the collapse of the Alau Dam and subsequent flash floods in Borno State, flood waters have receded in the worst-hit Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) and Jere local government areas (LGAs) offering some respite to affected people. Many are returning to their homes and to host communities, while those whose homes remain submerged are being relocated to larger, more centralized temporary sites within the State. The reduction and consolidation of temporary relocation sites is ongoing to better manage the situation and to ensure the return of public facilities such as schools to their intended purpose. Several schools in Borno had been repurposed to accommodate flood-affected people. Humanitarian needs, however, remain critical despite the significant reduction in the number of displaced people living in emergency shelters, from a peak of 400,000 people at the height of flooding to about 50,000 registered individuals as of 4 October, according to the Borno State Government (BSG) Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). An additional 700,000 people also sought shelter with relatives during the flood emergency, according to authorities. Over 320 people dead, 1.3 million affected by floods in 34 states in Nigeria.

       "   'disaster_description': 'A 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck off Lombok, province of West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, at 05:47 local time, on 29 July 2018, followed by 66 aftershocks with the highest of those with a recorded magnitude of 5.7. The earthquake affected the three districts of North Lombok, East Lombok and West Lombok. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the quake was centred 50 kilometres northeast of the city Mataram on the northern part of Lombok island, with a depth of 10 km. Indonesia’s agency for meteorology climatology and geophysics (BMKG) indicated that there was no risk of a tsunami. The quake also impacted Mount Rinjani national park, a popular trekking destination. Access to the climbing routes are temporarily closed due to reports of a landslide around the mountain. The West Nusa Tenggara administration declared a seven-day state of emergency. The earthquake has claimed at least 17 lives. As of 1 August, the National Disaster and Mitigation Agency (BNPB) had recorded 10,062 displaced people and 5,448 destroyed houses across Lombok, most of which are located in East Lombok regency. More than 90 people have been killed and hundreds more have been injured in a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that took place in Lombok, Indonesia on the evening of 5 August. This second earthquake followed the 6.4 magnitude quake that struck the same area on 29 July. As of 12 August 2018, National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB) and Command Post for Lombok Earthquake have verified an overall fatalities number of 392, 1,353 people injured, and 387,067 people displaced. In addition, a total of 67,875 houses damaged, along with 6 bridges, 606 schools, 3 hospitals, and 20 office buildings. As of 15 August, the series of earthquakes and aftershocks in Lombok Island have caused 460 deaths, 7,733 injured and 417,259 displaced people, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB). An initial damage assessment to infrastructure reports over 72,000 houses damaged, as well as 52 health facilities, 128 religious facilities and 6 bridges damaged. On 19 August, a 7M earthquake struck Lombok. It was preceded by a 6.3M earthquake and was followed by a number of aftershocks. The epicenter was 30km northeast of East Lombok, and was 20 km deep. As of 20 August, ten people are known to have died and 24 people have been injured. More than 150 houses have been damaged and widespread power outages have been reported. The earthquake caused a number of landslides and was felt across East Lombok, North Lombok, West Sumbawa, Sumbawa Besar, West Lombok and Mataram City, as well as Bali, East Java and Makassar. As of 24 August, more than 390,500 people remain displaced as a result of the earthquakes. Following the earthquakes, 555 people are known to have died. More than 80,500 houses have been damaged, while six hospitals, more than 170 health centres and 859 schools have been affected. As of 1 October, according to BNPB, the four quakes during July and August killed more than 510 people, injured at least 7,100 others, and displaced more than 431,000 people with 88,740 houses and 798 public and social facilities destroyed or damaged. In mid-September, the provincial authorities announced a six-month period of transitioning from emergency to recovery. Regardless the fact that the IDPs have access to cook and have capacity to buy their food, the food availability for infant is very limited. 1,796 camps have no supplement for kids, 1,948 camps have no supplement for woman in pregnancy or breastfeeding and breastfeeding counselor is not accessible for 10,526 breastfeeding mothers in 1,929 camps. Out of recorded IDPs camps, there are 251 camps that have not received Non Food Items relief during their displacement. The total of IDPs in those 251 camps is 30,400 people. According to BNPB reports, over 129,000 houses were damaged and more than 445,000 people have been internally displaced. These people are living with various types of shelters, across 2,700 camps as well as with host communities. The Government of Indonesia is leading the recovery efforts in Lombok and Sumbawa and planning to provide cash to 75,000 affected households to rebuild their homes. As of 16 November, more than six weeks after the disaster, many needs remain. Priorities include logistics and economic recovery, medical assistance, clean water, sanitation and hygiene, recovery of infrastructure and public services, shelter, protection, including women’s and children’s protection, and education. Humanitarian response has made significant progress in reaching and serving the people in need of assistance. Regional and international agencies continue to support national efforts and leadership. NGOs, the Red Cross and the UN are on the ground augmenting the national response. Four months on from the disaster, situation in the province continues to improve, school activities have started again, and people have started trade. Condition in some parts of the earthquake affected areas is becoming more conducive, people have started repairing their houses respectively. However, significant humanitarian needs remain. Currently PMI continues providing services to the public such as health care, psychosocial support Services, restoring family links, safe water distribution, shelters, and distribution of food and non-food Items. As of 27 December 2018, more than 509,000 people have been affected by the earthquakes in Lombok. 515 people died, thousands of people were seriously injured or suffered from minor injuries, and over 431,000 people were displaced. Local authorities initially reported that more than 140,000 houses were damaged as a result of the earthquakes. The result of recovery assessment conducted in Lombok during November 2018 indicated over 129,000 houses were damaged, and more than 445,000 people have been internally displaced following the earthquake. Displaced families dispersed across 2,700 small scale displacement sites in proximity of their villages, as well as with host communities. Health services were disrupted by the earthquakes resulting in over 340 damaged health facilities.

The number could increase once the census is consolidated with the information obtained from rural areas. On 5 May, a collapse inside the third tunnel of the Hidroituango Dam project (Antioquia Department) increased the levels of the Cauca river in the area.

Following these events, 544 people were evacuated (250 in official shelters) and 60 houses destroyed. Further events in the dam, which is in risk of collapse, have led to the evacuation of more than 9,000 people. According to the authorities, there are around 180,000 people at high risk. On 14 May, the Antioquia State Government declared Public Calamity. The Antioquia Governor estimates that in the worst scenario of the dam's rupture, 113,000 people would be affected.

Search and rescue operations are ongoing, under the leadership of local authorities with the support from the Ethiopian Red Cross and community members. The death toll is expected to rise, according to local authorities. A similar, but lower-scale landslide incident had occurred in May 2024 in the same area, where more than 50 people had died. Weather extremes, such as floods and droughts, have been major drivers of humanitarian needs in Ethiopia. The scale of the impact of the incident, including displacement and damages to livelihoods, will be further clarified once the planned multi-agency assessment is completed. The death toll continues to rise after the landslides triggered by heavy rainfall that occurred on 21-22 July in Gezei Gofa Woreda of Gofa Zone (South Ethiopia Region, south-western Ethiopia). According to media, at least 229 people have died while the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) reports 600 people have been displaced due to the events. As of 26 July, the situation in Gezei Gofa Woreda was reported to have left 236 confirmed dead and 13 rescued making it Ethiopia’s deadliest landslide.

Since the Federal Ministry of Health confirmed the first two AWD cases on 9 June, the number of confirmed cases are increasing. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute reported about 2,145 (nationally) and 25 (in Addis Ababa) suspected AWD cases as of 12 June 2016. In week 15 (week ending 16 April 2017), a total of 2,388 suspected cases of AWD/cholera were reported in Afar, Amhara and Somali regions of the country. Somali region remains the most affected, accounting for 99% of the new cases reported in the reporting week. On 20 April 2017, WHO elevated the outbreak of AWD/cholera and the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia to grade 3 emergency. Since the beginning of 2017, a total of 37,459 cases including 784 deaths (case fatality rate 2.1%) have been reported from six regions of Somali, Oromia, Amhara, Afar, SNNP and Tigray. Eighty-nine percent of the reported cases and 96% of the deaths were reported in Somali Region alone. A 27 per cent increase in the number of AWD cases was reported nationwide last week, mainly due to spikes in new cases reported in Amhara and Tigray regions and a resurgence of the outbreak in Afar region where community transmission of the disease is widespread. The high risk for further spread of the AWD outbreak continues due to the degradation of health determinants on the back drop of overburdened local health systems, including inadequate access to safe drinking water and internal and cross-border movements.

Some 800 metric tons of food, nutrition, health, WASH and shelter supplies are awaiting delivery. The logistics sector and WFP are exploring the possibilities of bringing in relief from Cameroon. The rainy season has greatly reduced access to places that are in severe need of immediate sector interventions. LGAs like Gwoza, Ngala, Kaga Balge, Dikwa, Damboa, and Bama among other locations have IDPs and returnees living in deteriorated shelter conditions, while emergency shelter interventions have been delayed due to lack of response capacities, security, access, land availability and logistics needed to set up appropriate sites. As the rainy season approaches in Nigeria, floods are expected to affect many sites situated in flood-vulnerable locations in Borno state. The flood vulnerability mapping indicates that about 59 camps could be exposed to flooding hazards, as they are located along or close to water flow accumulation areas. Paired with the continuous influx of IDPs to existing sites and to Local Government Areas, overstretching capacities on the ground, and the level of congestion in IDP sites, this will increase health and sanitation concerns. In addition to the risk associated with access and sanitation, the preparation to the rainy season requires urgent interventions in terms of NFI and retrofitting of unsafe shelter units, through the provision of emergency shelter materials to reinforce the structures against strong winds and rains.

According to the National Institute for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction (INGD), more than 175,000 people have been affected by the cyclone in Mozambique, and over 8,000 houses have been destroyed, damaged, or flooded. Thus far, six people are confirmed dead since Eloise made landfall on Saturday. Three days later, a total of 32 accommodation centres have been activated in Sofala province to provide temporary shelter for over 15,000 men, women and children. According to an assessment by the IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) and Mozambique’s INGD, needs at these accommodation centres include food, tents, potable water, hygiene kits, COVID-19 prevention materials, mosquito nets, blankets, flashlights, tarps, health kits, and soap. The Tropical storm landed in South Africa on the 24 January 2021 after it was predicted by South African Weather Service. According to a Government report through its Command-and-Control Centre, some 3,200 people (640 HH) in Kwa Zulu Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces have been affected by heavy rains and flooding following Tropical Storm Eloise. The tropical storms also extended to other provinces with no damages. The floods triggered by the heavy rain have reportedly killed four people so far. Across all the three provinces, homes were partially or completely destroyed, families. In January 2021, Tropical Cyclone Eloise, swept through large parts of the region, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds, including in Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa. Eloise killed at least 12 people (One in Madagascar and 11 in Mozambique) and affected more than 467,000 people across the region, including 2,800 in Madagascar, 441,690 in Mozambique, 3,200 in South Africa and 20,270 in Zimbabwe. Mozambique’s central provinces, which were still recovering from the devastation wrought by Cyclone Idai in 2019, were hardest-hit by Tropical Cyclone Eloise.',\n",

By 18 April 2022, the outbreak had spread to other areas within Lusaka with a cumulative total of 16 suspected cases of which 8 were confirmed, distributed as follows: Lusaka Province – 7 (Lusaka District 12; - Mtendere 4, Kabangwe 1, Kamwala 1 and Matero 1), Chilanga District (Midles-west 2, Apolo1, and ZESCO Kalundu 2) Northern Province 5 (Nsama District – Nsumbu 5).

Although this cholera outbreak has occurred outside the rainy season, it has the potential to mimic the 2017-2018 outbreak, which started in one area and spread to other hotspots within Lusaka, and eventually to other parts of the country. Already, there are reports of suspected cases in Nsumbu area in Nsama District in Northern Province, and the Ministry of Health is yet to rule out epidemiological link between the two events through a risk assessment and patients record tracking. Once the risk assessment report is shared with partners, it will become clearer regarding the situation and gaps in the response strategy. However, MoH has put in place systems for the response and a Lusaka Provincial multi-sectoral response plan is being finalised and will be shared with relevant stakeholders. Zambia faces challenges to attain universal access to safe and clean drinking water, as well as inadequate sanitation, especially in densely populated and unplanned settlements in urban settings. These conditions, coupled with the poor hygiene practices among citizens, has caused recurrent outbreaks of WASH related diseases. To note, although Cholera is endemic in Zambia, the country has not had an outbreak since 2019 owing to various cholera preventive interventions being implemented within the context of the country’s Multi-sectoral Cholera Elimination Plan.',\n",

Thirteen cases were confirmed from Syria's Deir Al Zour province. The occurrence of an outbreak reflects declining immunization rates due to the severe interruption of public health services and to the conditions in which the people are living. A comprehensive outbreak response will need to be implemented across the region, with seven countries and territories to conduct mass polio vaccination campaigns targeting more than 22 million children aged under 5 years. As of 8 Feb 2014, 17 confirmed polio cases had been reported from Syria's Deir ez-Zour Governorate, three from Aleppo Governorate, one from Al. Hasakeh Governorate and two from Idleb Governorate. By 20 Mar, a total of 37 cases had been reported: 25 cases by the Syrian Arab Republic Ministry of Health, and 12 cases from contested areas (Aleppo, Edleb and Deir Al Zour) not yet reflected in official figures. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 17 Dec 2013. Further evidence of regional spread was confirmed by notification of a case from Iraq, the first polio case in the country since 2000. The case, a six-month old boy from Baghdad who had not been immunized, developed paralysis on 10 Feb 2014. Genetic sequencing indicates the virus is most closely related to virus detected in the Syrian Arab Republic. By 8 Oct, three cases had been reported in the Middle East with onset of paralysis in 2014 - two in Iraq and one in Syria. The most recent case reported from Iraq occurred in Mada'in district, Baghdad-Resafa province, with onset of paralysis on 7 Apr. Syria’s most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 Jan. The fact that six months had passed with no new cases being reported indicates that transmission of the virus has been interrupted.\",\n",

The maximum sustained winds are currently at 95 kilometers per hour, although a significant increase in its strength and large swells is expected as the system approaches the southern waters of Cuba. Five western provinces and the special municipality of Isla de la Juventud remain under cyclone alert, with over 3.8 million people potentially exposed to the impacts of the system. At the same time, the central and eastern regions of the country are experiencing the effects of intense rainfall associated with a trough. Both Tropical Storm Rafael and the trough arrive less than three weeks after the eastern part of Cuba, particularly the province of Guantánamo, suffered the impacts of Hurricane Oscar, which resulted in eight fatalities, two people missing, and substantial material damage. The trajectory forecasts for the new storm predominantly cover the provinces of Artemisa, Pinar del Río, and the special municipality of Isla de la Juventud, but they also predict potential damage in the capital city, which would pose risks to infrastructure and housing. Significant impacts on agriculture, livelihoods, and electrical infrastructure are also anticipated amid a complex energy situation.',\n",
       "   'interventions': \"48 hours after the impact of Hurricane Rafael in western and central Cuba, preliminary figures show significant damage to homes, electrical infrastructure and basic services, as well as agriculture, in a context of ongoing response to Hurricane Oscar, which affected eastern Cuba three weeks ago. So far, no human losses have been reported, and specialized brigades have been deployed from nearby provinces to support the recovery, including the restoration of basic services and cleaning up debris. The greatest damage is concentrated in the province of Artemisa, where the hurricane severely impacted its 11 municipalities. The intense damage includes the demolition of 10 electricity towers. Several communities are cut off or very difficult to access due to falling trees and power lines, as well as flooding and overflowing rivers. Approximately 800,000 people have suffered the damages caused by this powerful hurricane in the most exposed territories of Artemisa, Mayabeque, Havana and Isla de la Juventud. Following Hurricane Rafael, severe damage to the electrical system caused the water supply to be affected in the western provinces. A week after the impact, in the province of Artemisa, only 17% of the inhabitants had recovered the water supply service and in Havana, only 20%. In Mayabeque, the interruption of electricity service and water pumping continued in the municipalities of Batabanó, Quivicán, Melena del Sur and Nueva Paz. The impact of Hurricane Rafael has so far left (damage is still quantified), some 25,471 homes with various damages, concentrating its impact in the province of Artemisa with more than 83% of the damage. Severe effects predominate considering the ravages of strong category 3 winds. As a result, some 92,000 victims have been identified. At the same time, around 60,000 people (20,000 families) have been identified with severe problems in accessing electricity; they have had coverage with small photovoltaic systems as an immediate alternative, among others to access water. At the same time, damage to the conventional power grid has affected an additional 305,000 people. With Hurricane Rafael, a total of 144 health institutions were damaged in the three affected provinces of the western region. These include 28 hospitals, 43 polyclinics, 123 family doctor's offices and 51 other types of clinics. In Artemisa, significant damage is reported in two hospitals, the José Ramón Martínez Pediatric Hospital in Guanajay and the Ciro Redondo García General Hospital in the municipality of Artemisa.\",\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'Dengue continues to be the arbovirus with the highest number of reported cases in the Americas region, with outbreaks occurring on a cyclical basis every 3 to 5 years. During the year 2024 between epidemiological weeks 1 and 16 of 2024, a total of 6,769,140 suspected cases of dengue were reported (cumulative incidence of 717 cases per 100,000 population). This figure represents an increase of 206% compared with the same period in 2023 and 387% compared with the average for the last 5 years. On 16 February 2024, in view of the exponential increase in dengue cases observed in the first weeks of the year in several countries of the Region of the Americas, PAHO made an urgent appeal to Member States. The organization emphasized the need to intensify vector control measures and to maintain active surveillance, ensuring early diagnosis and timely treatment of cases. On 7 March 2024, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) of Guatemala, through the Directorate of Epidemiology and Risk Management, issued an epidemiological alert for dengue. This alert was established to reinforce dengue control and prevention plans, based on data accumulated up to epidemiological week 7, which ended on 17 February. As of that date, a total of 6,760 cases of dengue fever had been recorded this year, of which 31 were severe cases resulting in 3 deaths. The decision to issue this alert was motivated by the beginning of the high dengue transmission season in the country. As part of this measure, specific epidemiological surveillance actions were reinforced, including standardized protocols for the detection, notification, and registration of cases in hospitals and health areas. On 27 June, at a meeting of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the national level, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) verbally requested the National Society to replace the intervention in the department of Suchitepequez with that of Zacapa. This request was based on the significant increase of dengue cases in Zacapa and a considerable decrease in Suchitepequez. The request was made in response to evidence of the most affected areas and the shortage of personnel and resources needed by SPAS to address the national dengue emergency. Up to the 34th epidemiological week, 80,234 cases of dengue fever have been reported in the country. According to the same report, 14 of the 29 Departmental Directorates of Integrated Health Services Networks (DDRISS) reported an incidence of dengue that exceeds the national average. Among the most affected departments are Jutiapa, Santa Rosa, Zacapa, El Progreso, Baja Verapaz, Sacatepéquez, Quetzaltenango, Retalhuleu, Jalapa, Escuintla, Suchitepéquez, Chiquimula, and the northwestern and northeastern areas of Guatemala. Notably, the DDRISS of Zacapa, Suchitepéquez and Jutiapa have registered the highest incidence of dengue with alarm signs.',\n",

Most of the people affected have already faced years of being uprooted from their homes due to conflict. At least 62 camps and 2,558 tents have been damaged or destroyed by the storm, often sweeping away the only possessions people had after nearly a decade of displacement. Tens of thousands of people scattered to find shelter from the ongoing storm in schools and mosques. Others were forced to sleep in the open air last night, in temperatures below zero.

According to the Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) more than 24,354 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in 99 sites were affected by the recent flood as of 24 January. It has resulted in one death and three injuries with some 4,575 tents either destroyed or damaged. Heavy rainfall and strong winds have resulted in flooding across north-western Syria since mid-January. According to the Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) cluster in Gaziantep, close to 142,000 Internally Displaced People (IDPs) were affected across 407 IDP sites. The number of fatalities stands at one and three individuals have been injured. About 25,600 tents have been damaged or destroyed and several roads, leading to camps and pathways within camps, have been severely affected. In March, heavy winds across northwest Syria resulted in damage to 88 IDP sites. According to the CCCM Cluster, from 11 to 24 March, some 1,521 tents were damaged as a result of the heavy winds, with families forced to temporarily move in with relatives and neighbours in the IDP sites. The heavy winds increased the need for tent replacements, food, and plastic sheets, compounding with existing needs caused by the flooding incidents and winterisation needs in recent months.

       "   'disaster_description': 'On Saturday, 14 August a major 7.2-magnitude earthquake hit Haiti. According to Haiti’s Office for Civil Protection, 227 have died and the figure is sadly expected to increase in the coming hours. Preliminary reports by Haitian Red Cross volunteers and IFRC staff on the ground confirm that the earthquake has caused severe damage to infrastructure, including hospitals, especially in Jérémie and Les Cayes, at the Northern coast of the Southern peninsula of the country. Hospitals and hotels, as well as ports, bridges and routes are reported to have been damaged in Les Cayes and Jérémie, where churches collapsed while the morning mass was being celebrated. Search and rescue activities are concentrated in that area as there may be people trapped in the rubble. While preliminary assessments are still in their very early stages, the Haitian Civil Protection General Directorate (DGPC) reports more than 700 collapsed buildings, including hospitals, schools and churches, and 2,410 destroyed homes in the department of Nippes and 1,368 in Grand’Anse, forcing at least 470 people to seek refuge in shelters, with thousands more thought to be displaced. DGPC also reports at least 304 dead and around 1,800 more injured, figures likely to increase significantly in the coming hours and days as more are still missing. The death toll following the earthquake of 14 August has raised to 2,189 people while 332 are still missing, and more than 12,200 have been injured, as reported by the Haitian Civil Protection. At least 52,000 houses have been destroyed and more than 77,000 damaged. The powerful 7.2-magnitude earthquake which struck south-western Haiti on 14 August affected at least 800,000 people, including 340,000 children, and resulted in the death of more than 2,240 people. According to the Haitian General Directorate of Civil Protection (DGPC) and IOM, as of 20 September, an estimated 38,777 displaced people have been identified in 89 displacement locations across the three most affected departments – Grand’Anse, Nippes and Sud – with more than half of these people located in 44 locations in the Sud Department. For the more than 12,700 injured people, access to adequate healthcare remains a challenge, as the quake damaged or destroyed approximately 90 health centres, with 60 per cent of affected people stating that health services close to them have been interrupted, according to UNICEF’s U-Report survey. The rollout of the new school year has been severely hindered by the earthquake’s multifaceted impacts, with more than 900 schools – around 70 per cent of all schools in south-western Haiti – damaged or destroyed. The majority of schools have been unable to reopen their doors to students just as 300,000 children were set to gradually resume classes in the three quake-affected departments on 4 October. UNICEF estimates that if classrooms remain closed, following a one-month delay in school reopening in affected departments, more than 230,000 children are at risk of dropping out of school. The earthquake has triggered a spike in international migration from Haiti, compounding the existing migration crisis of Haitians in the Americas, with increasing numbers of Haitian nationals arriving on the shores of neighbouring countries.',\n",
       "   'interventions': 'The Government and high-ranking UN officials negotiated humanitarian access for a relief convoy to pass through the main road linking the capital Port-au-Prince to the country’s southern peninsula which, up to now, had been blocked by gangs for months, with further convoys set to deliver various supplies. On 16 August, DG ECHO mobilised €3 million in emergency humanitarian funding to address the most urgent needs of the affected population. On 16 August, the Government of Haiti sent a request for international assistance to the EU Delegation in Port-au-Prince. France, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden have already offered in-kind assistance via the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. An EU Civil Protection Team was deployed to support the national authorities and coordinate the incoming EU assistance. The mission will be supported by a Technical Assistance and Support Team from the Swedish Civil Protection (MSB). More than two weeks after the devastating 14 August earthquake, humanitarian assistance is now beginning to reach those most in need faster, facilitated by enhanced Government-led coordination and robust efforts to negotiate increased humanitarian access into hard-to reach areas. The combined impact of the earthquake and Tropical Depression Grace have left 650,000 thousand people in need of emergency humanitarian assistance, of which 500,000 are being targeted by UN agencies and humanitarian partners through the activities planned under the recently launched $187.3 million Flash Appeal. From 14 August to 1 December, over 300,185 people received emergency assistance, with 4,032 mt of food and USD 2.4 million in cash-based transfers distributed. Fuel scarcity and insecurity increased starting mid-October. A truce from mid-November saw fuel distribution slowly resume throughout the country. WFP received and responded to a significant number of fuel requests from partners prioritizing medical emergencies and life-saving activities. Road access to the areas impacted by the earthquake was restricted and truck convoys from Port-au-Prince to the south were suspended as of mid-October. WFP continued its barge service from Port-au-Prince to the commune of Carrefour in the suburban area of the capital to transport humanitarian assistance to the south. Since the earthquake, over 130 voyages have been organised. Despite these delays and challenges, distributions by WFP and partners continued. Access to basic healthcare, nutrition, and safe water, sanitation, and hygiene services remains critical with important needs after the devastating earthquake that hit southwestern Haiti on 14 August. According to the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), total damages and loss are estimated at US$ 1.62 billion, while recovery needs at US$ 1.98 billion. Relief efforts have been severely hampered by a shortage of fuel throughout the country, while the humanitarian corridor has been interrupted due to increased gangs’ violence and insecurity. UNICEF water trucking facilitated access to water for drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene for approximately 419,000 persons (69,000 in the reporting period). The construction of 75 blocks of latrines for the sites hosting the displaced people is ongoing, in respect of accessibility standards for people with disabilities.',\n",

As of 25 September evening, Penama provincial authorities had a record of approximately 6,800 people in evacuation centres on Ambae with an additional 900 people who have yet to be evacuated. Host communities and provincial authorities are currently supporting evacuee needs. The Provincial Disaster Committee is currently leading the response on the ground. The National Disaster Management Office advises that further evacuations are likely to occur if the situation escalates. The volcanic eruption at Ambae is continuing but remains stable and confined to Lake Voui. Further scientific analyses confirm that there is currently no evidence of escalation of the activity. As a consequence, the Volcanic Alert Level is lowered to Level 3 from Level 4. The volcanic eruption is likely to continue in a steady state. Danger is restricted to the danger zone that extends 3 km from the active vent in Lake Voui. As of 18 October, the government said a state of emergency would be in place at least until 24 October. The government has decided to repatriate 11,000 evacuees from Ambae. The NDMO is preparing a logistics plan for the return, which will be handled by the government.

As of 30 July 2023, according to reports from various sources including the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) and the Afghan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), flash floods have led to the loss of 61 lives, left 24 people injured and six people missing. The province of Maidan Wardak is the most impacted and accounts for 37 of the 61 human lives lost. Based on the preliminary findings of the initial rapid assessment carried out by the ARCS, approximately 126,000 people have been affected by the disaster in 18 provinces. The flash floods have also partially or completely damaged 1,360 residential houses and washed away over 13,023 hectares of agricultural land and killed at least 1,128 livestock. Some of the provinces such as Badakhshan, Maidain Wardak and Nangahar have experienced such floods for the first time while others have experienced more severe floods this year than the ones in the past. The country is particularly vulnerable to variations in access to arable land and water due to drought that have been affecting the country for the last three consecutive years. New areas are experiencing floods due to dryness of land caused by drought for three consecutive years. Between 1 and 30 July, heavy rains intensified and flash flooding affected some 6,193 people across eight provinces of Afghanistan – 1,071 people in Kabul; 1,345 people in Kunar; 130 people in Laghman, 1,617 people in Maidan Wardak; 755 people in Nangarhar, 574 people in Nuristan; 581 people in Parwan; and 120 people in Zabul. Some 40 people were reportedly killed and 30 others were injured, while some 551 houses were damaged, and 121 others were destroyed. OCHA and humanitarian partners are conducting assessments alongside providing lifesaving assistance to the affected families. The number of people affected is anticipated to increase based on forecasts of more heavy rains and flooding in August, according to the Afghanistan meteorological department. Of all the natural disasters that have occurred in Afghanistan this year, flash flooding and heavy rains caused the most havoc as of the end of August, followed by earthquakes and heavy snowfall during the 2022/2023 winter. In total, around 21,500 people (2,952 families) affected by flooding, with 51 people killed, a further 62 injured, and 553 houses destroyed, and significant damage caused to 1,950 homes in 23 provinces across the country. Floods and heavy rains have also reportedly destroyed more than 3,000 acres of agricultural land, 50 irrigation canals, and 20 Kms of road, forests and farm infrastructure. The damage was most extensive in the north-eastern, central, and southern regions where 8,640, 5,830, and 1,193 people respectively were affected. Communities living in the southeastern (917 people), western (490 people) and northeastern (360 people) areas were also impacted by the heavy rains.',\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'The 2020 Gu’ rains (April-June) have intensified across Somalia, triggering flash flooding in South West State, Jubaland, Bandir, Puntland and Somaliland from 20-23 April. As water levels rise in rivers, there are reports of riverine flooding in Jubaland. FAO’s Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) reported heavy rains in Somaliland where on 26 April, Lughaye and surrounding areas received unusually heavy rains of 102mm. On 23 April, heavy rains were also received within the Juba river basin. SWALIM forecasts increased rainfall activity in most areas in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands in the coming week, which is likely to keep the water levels high in the Shabelle and Juba rivers. The flooding has started barely four months after heavy Deyr (October-December) rains inundated parts of Somalia, affecting over half a million people; and as the country works to contain the COVID-19 virus, which is exponentially rising and has already infected several hundreds of people. The country is also working to contain a desert locust infestation. Since 20 April, heavy rain has been affecting most of Somalia States and territories (particularly South West, Jubaland, Banadir, Puntland, and Somaliland) as well as the neighbouring central and south Ethiopia since 24 April, causing rivers to overflow and triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The worst affected area is the Juba river basin and the Shabelle river basin. In Somalia, as of 29 April, media report 10 fatalities, a number of missing people, around 20 injured people, hundreds more displaced, as well as damage to infrastructure in Qardho Town (Bari Region, west Puntland). The number of people affected by flooding in Somalia has risen to 546,103, of whom 216,895 people have been displaced from their homes and 16 others killed since the Gu’ rains started in early April. At least 27 districts are inundated; the worst being Belet Weyne in Hiran region where riverine flooding has displaced more than 115,000 people, according to the district flood taskforce. This includes about 91,000 people who have been displaced from the four sections of the town and 23,220 people from 23 riverine villages. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy rains in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands. According to the taskforce, more people were fleeing their homes as river levels rise. As of 10 May, the river levels reached 7.93 meters which is 0.37 meter below the bank full level of 8.30 meters. Ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 918,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts, as of 16 May. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to crowding in areas where displaced people are seeking temporary shelter. As of 19 May, ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 919,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts. Belet Weyne in Hiraan region is the most affected district after the Shabelle river burst its banks on 12 May, inundating 85 per cent of Belet Weyne town and 25 riverine villages. According to the district flood taskforce, about 240,000 people were displaced from the town and neighbouring villages between 12 and 18 May. In Jowhar district, Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected more than 98,000 people in 37 locations, bringing the total affected in Hirshabelle to 338,000 people. According to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in Hirshabelle State, nearly 40 per cent of those affected in Jowhar have been displaced from their homes. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to overcrowding in areas where the displaced people are seeking temporary. Flash and riverine floods have since late June affected an estimated 191,800 people in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region. Among those affected, about 124,200 people have been displaced from their homes. Another 5,000 people are at risk of further displacement in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle. Since May, an estimated 149,000 hectares of farmland have been damaged by floods in 100 villages in Jowhar, Mahaday and Balcad districts, Middle Shabelle region. The latest floods point to a worrying pattern where extreme weather conditions are increasing in frequency and intensity. Prior to June 2020, flash floods and riverine flooding caused by seasonal rains displaced more than 450,000 in the country. With floods in 2018 and 2019 displacing 281,000 and 416,000 persons respectively, the flood-based displacement figures demonstrate a rising year-to-year trend. Somalia’s re-occurring climate related emergencies result in devastating impact on communities who heavily rely on farming and livestock for their livelihood. Riverine flooding continues to displace people and inundate farmland in rural areas mainly along the Shabelle river valley. The floods, which are attributed to the Hagaa seasonal rains, have affected nearly 500,000 people since late June in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland States, as well as Banadir region.',\n",

On 30 October at 0.00 UTC, its centre was approximately 275 km east-southeast of Quy Nhon City (Binh Dinh Province, central Vietnam) with maximum sustained winds of 65 km/h (tropical storm). Tropical depression MATMO was moving into Cambodia from Vietnam on 31 October and is expected to bring heavy rain to the central part of Thailand, where temperatures are also dropping over next few days. Strong winds and heavy rains have resulted in power loss and damaged buildings and houses in the southern central provinces of Binh Din and Phú Yên, Vietnam. The authorities evacuated around 15,000 households to safer places. A considerable rise of the water level of Rivers in Phú Yên, including Cai River have been observed representing a high flooding risk. In Quang Ngãi Province, many houses were damaged and trees were uprooted, particularly in local southern districts. The Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control of Vietnam reported, that Typhoon Matmo has destroyed 179 houses, damaged 2,314 buildings and 35 schools in the provinces of Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Gia Lai and Thua Thien Hue. As of 4 November, 1 person is reported missing, 14 people have been injured and 20,000 displaced. After passing over south-east Asia, Tropical Cyclone MATMO has reformed over the Bay of Bengal.

On 7-8 November, rain and thunderstorms are forecast over eastern Myanmar, Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India) and strong winds in West Bengal. Preparedness planning is ongoing in the Cox’s Bazar district in Bangladesh, which hosts close to a million refugees. The severe cyclonic storm ‘Bulbul’ has intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm as it moves towards the West Bengal and Bangladesh coast. The system is likely to intensify further before turning north-east across the West Bengal - Bangladesh coast between Sagar Islands and Khepupara, across Sundarbans delta on 10 November with maximum sustained wind speed of 110-120 km/h to 135 km/h. Heavy to very heavy rain and strong winds are forecast over West Bengal and Odisha coasts in India, and Khulna and Barisal divisions in Bangladesh over the next 4 days. As of 10 November, the system has weakened to a Cyclonic Storm with a maximum sustained wind speed of 80-90 km/h and centred over Southwestern part of Bangladesh. It is expected to further move northeasterly direction and weaken gradually. The number of fatalities in West Bengal State (India) and southern Bangladesh has increased to 20, after Tropical Cyclone BULBUL's passage on 9-10 November. According to media reports, 10 people died in West Bengal, and 2 more deaths were reported in Odisha State (north-east India). Over 26,000 houses were damaged. In Bangladesh, 8 people died, 15 fishermen are still missing, and at least 30 people are injured. More than 17,000 houses have been damaged and river embankments were breached in Barguna district (Barisal Division, southern Bangladesh). Disaster response teams from India and Bangladesh have been deployed to the affected areas and food and relief items are being distributed to the population.

       "   'disaster_description': 'There is an ongoing outbreak since the beginning of 2017. Between 1 January and 31 December 2017, a cumulative total of 4,221 suspected cholera cases and 107 deaths (CFR 2.5%), including 60 laboratory-confirmed were reported from 87 LGAs in 20 States. Between weeks 1 and 9 of 2018, there have been 210 suspected cases including two laboratory-confirmed and 16 deaths (CFR 7.6%) from 28 LGAs in 9 States. North-east Nigeria is experiencing recurrent cholera outbreaks, with three states: Adamawa, Borno and Yobe currently having active transmission. Since February 2018, the three states in north-east Nigeria have reported a total of 1,664 suspected cholera cases and 31 deaths (case fatality rate 1.9%), as of 27 May 2018. With more than 14 days since the last reported case of cholera, Yobe State Ministry of Health has declared that the outbreak is over on 12 June 2018. The outbreak of cholera in Nigeria has remained persistent since the beginning of 2018. In epi-week 28 (week ending 15 July 2018), 367 new suspected cases with four deaths (case fatality ratio 1.1%) were reported from six states – Adamawa (42), Bauchi (56), Katsina (68), Niger (14), Plateau (11), and Zamfara (176). As of 18 July 2018, a total of 16,892 suspected cases with 201 deaths (case fatality ratio 1.2%) have been reported from 17 states (Adamawa, Anambra, Bauchi, Borno, FCT, Gombe, Jigawa, Ebonyi, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kogi, Nasarawa, Niger, Plateau, Yobe, and Zamfara) since the beginning of 2018. With no new cases reported in the last four weeks in Anambra, Nasarawa, Borno, and Yobe States the outbreak is considered to be under control in these states. The decrease in the number of cases has also been reported from Adamawa State, which has been one of the epi-centres of this outbreak. This is contributing to the overall declining trend across the country except in Zamfara and Katsina States where the number of cases reported is still high. A total of 889 cases of suspected cholera have been recorded in eight local government areas (LGAs), including 19 deaths, as of 10 September 2018. This represents a fatality rate of 2.1 per cent. The number of cases has increased by 30 percent between 7 September and 10 September 2018, including one additional death. Jere, Magumeri and Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) have seen the largest spike in case numbers, largely due to the poor water, sanitation and hygiene conditions in these areas that are also congested. As of 26 September 2018, a total of 3,703 cases with 68 deaths (CFR 1.8%) have been reported from twelve health districts in four regions of the country, namely, Maradi, Dosso, Zender, and Tahoua regions. Madarounfa District in Maradi Region remains the most affected with 90% of the cumulative cases reported. The majority of cases are age 5 and above and females constitute 56.2% of the cases reported. A total of 34 samples have tested positive by culture for Vibrio cholerae 01 inaba. Fourteen percent of the cumulative cases reported are residents from Nigeria. In week 43 (week ending 28 October 2018), 173 new suspected cases with one death were reported from five states: Adamawa (92 cases with one death), Zamfara (37 cases), Borno (35 cases), Yobe (6 cases), and Katsina (4 cases). There is an overall downward trend in the number of cases across the country. The total number of suspected cholera cases in Borno reported between 26th November and 2nd December 2018 stands at 6,307 with 73 associated deaths. The total number of suspected cholera cases reported in Yobe state is 1,812 with 61 associated deaths (CFR 3.37%). In the state, up to 591 cases have been reported in Gulani LGA, 485 cases in Gujba LGA and 488 cases in Damaturu LGA. In Fune LGA, 181 cases were reported and 67 cases were reported in Potiskum LGA. Borno and Yobe States officially declared the end of cholera outbreaks on 15 January 2019 following zero new cases for more than two consecutive weeks. Across the country, a declining trend was noted since early November with zero cases reported in the last three weeks. In 2018, twenty states reported outbreaks of cholera across Nigeria with Bauchi, Zamfara, Borno, and Katsina states accounting for 74% of the cumulative cases. Suspicious cases remain concentrated in the states of Bayelsa (41) and Kano (6). Since the beginning of the year, 579 suspected cases have been reported, including 24 recorded deaths. On 18 June 2019, the State Ministry of Health of Adamawa State in north-east Nigeria officially declared a cholera outbreak in three local government areas (LGAs). The cholera outbreak started on 15 May 2019 (week 19) in Yola North LGA and spread to Girei LGA in week 22 and eventually to Yola South LGA in week 23 (week ending 9 June 2019). In week 24 (week ending 16 June 2019), 37 new suspected cholera cases were reported, with no deaths. From 15 May to 28 June 2019, a cumulative total of 156 cases with one death (CFR 0.6%) have been reported from three LGAs with the caseload distributed as follows: Yola North (74 cases with one death), Girei (79 cases with zero deaths), and Yola South (three cases with zero deaths). The number of cases of cholera reported in Adamawa State has been on a declining trend. On 25 September 2019, one new case was reported from Girei Local Government Area. From 15 May to 25 September 2019, a cumulative total of 774 cases with four deaths have been reported from four LGAs: Yola North (471 cases with two deaths), Girei (192 cases with one death), Yola South (110 cases with one death), and Song (1 case with zero deaths). Three new cases of cholera were reported in Adamawa State from 27 November to 6 December 2019 from Yola North (2) and Yola South (1) Local Government Areas. From 15 May to 6 December 2019, a cumulative total of 839 suspected cases with four deaths have been reported from four LGAs: Yola North (513 cases with two deaths), Girei (200 cases with one death), Yola South (125 cases with one death), and Song (1 case with zero deaths). Of 539 stool specimens collected and analysed at the state specialist hospital, 206 cultured Vibrio cholerae as the causative agent. An outbreak of cholera has also been reported in Andoni Local Government Area, Rivers State. From 27 November to 9 December 2019, a total of 56 cases with 11 deaths were reported from 15 communities in Andoni LGA. As at March 28th, 2021, a total of 1,746 suspected cases including 50 deaths (CFR = 2.9%) have been reported from eight states (Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto and Nasarawa) since the beginning of 2021. Very active inter-community transmission in Nigeria, specifically in Bauchi, and Kano states, which have recorded 2,535 cases and 18 deaths (CFR 0.7%), and 572 cases including 19 (CFR 3.3%) deaths respectively in the last two weeks. In total Nigeria has 18 states in epidemic out of 36 states in the country, with 3,650 cases and 47 total deaths in the last two weeks. A total of 27.8% of the cases since the beginning of the year are children aged 5 to 14. Nigeria is experiencing one of its worst cholera outbreaks in years. According to Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Cholera Situation Report No. 38, as of 21st September 2021, a total of 73,055 suspected cases including 2,407 deaths (CFR 3.3%) have been reported from 27 states out of 36 states and in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). With over 2,407 people dead from suspected cholera this year, there are concerns that there might be an undercount given that many affected communities are in hard-to-reach areas with high security challenges. Indeed, although the overall situation across the country seemed to be improving with significant reduction of cases as of week 32, it has also been highlighted those cases are being reported in additional states and cases increasing again as of week 38 in areas where it had dropped. Since June 2021, a continuous increase in cholera cases has been reported. So far, cholera has killed about 3,300 persons and infected about 94,000. The case fatality rate is 3.5 per cent, higher than the previous annual outbreaks in the past four years.

Six cases have been confirmed, four from Somalia (Banadir and Bay region) and two from Kenya (Dadaab in north-eastern Kenya). The first case was confirmed in Somalia on 9 May 2013 and in Kenya on 22 May. This was the first outbreak in Somalia since 2007 and in Kenya since 2011. Outbreak campaigns have been launched in both countries. Immunization campaigns are planned and being conducted in neighboring Ethiopia and Yemen to boost population immunity levels and minimize the risk of spread of the outbreak. As of 1 Jul, 25 cases had been reported from Somalia (primarily from Banadir region) and six from Kenya (Dadaab in north-eastern Kenya). As of 14 Aug, Somalia had the worst outbreak in the world in a non-endemic country with 105 cases confirmed. About 10 cases of wild polio had been confirmed in Kenya. As of 14 Oct, six cases of polio had been confirmed in Ethiopia. Three cases had been reported in South Sudan, but were retracted on 26 Oct due to laboratory error. As of the end of 2013, the polio outbreak in the Horn of Africa was on the decline and the total number of polio cases stood at 203 (183 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya and six from Ethiopia). The most recent case in the region had onset of paralysis on 9 Oct (from Lower Shabelle, Somalia). By 18 Jun 2014, the total number of cases in the region was 219 since the beginning of the outbreak in Apr 2013 (195 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya and 10 from Ethiopia). Two new cases of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in South Sudan in the week of 4 Nov. Both were from Rubkona district of Unity province.

As a result, the Niger Red Cross Society is activating its Early Action Protocol (EAP) for Floods. ( IFRC, 1 Sep 2022 ) On 2 September, feedback was received from the SATHORIO that the Niamey hydrometeorological station temporarily malfunctioned during the period from 28 August to 3 September 2022, As a result, the water threshold in the bulletin dated 29 August 2022 was incorrect, which was the bulletin used to activate the EAP. Moreover, the wrong interpretation of the meteorological data was also influenced by the heavy rainfall recorded during the same period downstream of the river. Therefore, the EAP activation was a false alarm. At this time, based on the information from National Coordination Unit (NCU), and in coordination with the National Director of Hydraulics (DHN), early actions were paused pending further clarification. On 8 September, a field visit was organized including representatives from the CRN, the Ministry of Humanitarian Actions and Early Warning Systems, Direction of Civil Protection, National Director of Hydraulics, the local Administrative Authority, Niger Basin Authority and IFRC. The field visit identified that in addition to the false alarm mentioned above, the protective embankment is being raised (work started in August 2022) to more than 650 cm (photo 2 and 3), along the river in the Niamey River by the Disaster Risk Management and Urban Development Project (DRMP-UD). Following the field visit, on 12 September, it was unanimously decided that the probability of flooding was very low (less than 20%), therefore, the EAP actions should stop.

       "   'disaster_description': \"A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck 30 km west of Port Vila, Vanuatu, on 17 December 2024, at 12:47 PM local time. A tsunami warning was issued but has since been lifted. Search and rescue operations are ongoing at the time of reporting. Preliminary reports indicate observed damages to buildings and infrastructure in Port Vila, with six unconfirmed casualties and injuries reported. According to UNOSAT initial exposure analysis, an estimate of 116,000 people could be affected by the worst impacts of the earthquake. Telecommunications remain disrupted and is affecting the timeliness of field reports from remote areas. Access to the airport and water port is severely limited due to road damage. Key immediate needs include healthcare support, shelter, access to clean water, and the restoration of emergency communications. As of 18th December, NDMO confirmed 14 fatalities either from collapsed buildings or landslides. The numbers may rise as search and rescue operations intensifies and expands. Over 200 are reported injured while many are still missing. According to UNICEF staff on the ground, most injuries are fractures, cuts and traumas related to falling objects and sharp items. According to NDMO, two major water reservoirs in Port Vila are severely damaged. Assessment of water network is ongoing with affected residents already rationing water. Approximately 80,000 people have been directly affected by the earthquake, of which 14,104 are children and 769 are persons with disabilities (PWD). The Disaster Evacuation Centre Management Cluster (DEMC) reports that 947 people have been displaced. Infrastructure damage is extensive, with landslides further obstructing road access in Efate and outer islands, including routes to the Seaport. The airport is currently closed to all commercial flights. Physical Access challenges continue to hamper response efforts. The situation in Vanuatu remains critical following the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck on December 17, 2024. VMGD has confirmed that approximately 300 aftershocks, ranging from magnitudes of 2.0 to 5.3, have occurred with shallow depths between December 17 and December 19. The earthquake has resulted in significant devastation, with the death toll rising to 14 (eight males, five females, one unknown) and 265 injuries. Two major water reservoirs in Port Vila sustained severe damage, and ongoing assessments of the water network have led to water rationing for residents. Port Vila International Airport resumed commercial flights on 22 December, following consultations with airport agencies. However, landslides and damaged roads and bridges have hindered access to the airport and seaport. While the airport is operational, the seaport is still closed. The situation is compounded by the ongoing cyclone season, with three tropical cyclones predicted in the region posing more risks to already vulnerable populations. State of Emergency (SOE) concluded on December 24, 2024 with the coordination of operations transitioning to the Recovery Operations Centre (ROC) under the Prime Minister's Office. The NDMO, National Cluster Partners and Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) members are coordinating ongoing distribution of relief items to meet needs identified under the SOE including shelter, WASH, Protection, Health, Food and other essential supplies. Power, Water and phone service has been largely restored though internet services are still under repair. The situation in Vanuatu remains critical following the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck on December 17, 2024. Ongoing aftershocks pose a high risk of landslides and building collapses. The earthquake has resulted in at least 14 fatalities and more than 265 injuries. 1,092 people remain temporarily displaced, 570 houses have been damaged affecting 2,850 people. Infrastructure damage is extensive, with landslides obstructing road access to Efate and the outer islands, including the main seaport. In the education sector, 110 classrooms across 45 schools have been partially or completely damaged. Now that the State of Emergency has ended, the government has established a Recovery Operation Centre (ROC). In early January, the Director of the Department of Strategic Policy, Planning, and Aid Coordination (DSPPAC) and the Chairman of the ROC estimated that around CHF 217 million (VUV 29 billion) was needed to fund the recovery. As of 21 January, VRCS has reached an estimated total of 9,072 people with the support of its partners, including the IFRC. As of 17 January 2025, the Vanuatu Displacement and Evacuation Centre Management (DECM) cluster reported 315 people remained formally displaced. Of these, 39 were staying in two evacuation centres, while the remaining 364 were staying with 25 host households. It is likely that there are others who are displaced and staying with family and friends. On 7 January 2025, the Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) reported that 570 houses had been identified as damaged. The PHT also reported that the 13 health facilities in affected areas were functional, although some required minor repairs. The Ministry of Education and Training has assessed over 200 schools and identified that 45 schools were partially or completely damaged as a result of the earthquake. It is estimated it will cost over US$8 million (over CHF 7.2 million) to rebuild damaged schools. As of 7 February 2025, the Vanuatu Displacement and Evacuation Centre Management (DECM) cluster reported 124 people remained formally displaced. Of these, 21 were staying in one evacuation centres, while the remaining 103 were staying with 14 host households. It is likely that there are others who are displaced and staying with family and friends. It identified water, food, medical supplies, and shelter kits as key needs for those who had been displaced.\",\n",

       "   'disaster_description': \"A disaster official on Vanuatu's Ambae island said the island was again being blanketed by ash and acid rain, only months after residents returned. Government officials raised the Volcanic Alert Level from 2 to 3 on 18 March 2018. Ambae volcano is a very large volcano and is frequently active. Eruptions have been recorded every 10 to 50 years over the past 150 years. The current eruption is focused in the summit crater. As of 16 April, the volcano once again spewed out ash and harmful smoke. Vanuatu's government is now looking into acquiring land to permanently resettle the island's 13,000 residents. The Council of Ministers has declared a State of Emergency on Ambae Island. Approximately 750 people have lost their homes, 643 as a result of the volcanic ash, and 115 by landslides. The Council of Ministers has ordered the entire population to evacuate the island. As of 27 April, there has been resistance to the mandatory evacuation plan over a 2-week period between 1 to 15 May. The Penama provincial government declared that they will purchase land on the West and East of Ambae to accommodate people who need to evacuate from the worst affected areas. The proportion of the population who will require on-/off-island assistance remains unclear, and it is anticipated that evacuated populations will require emergency shelter assistance and household items. As of 15 May, the volcanic activity has decreased with reduced ashfall experienced during the first two weeks of May. The ash has, however, increased the risk of landslides, two of which were triggered by heavy rain and destroyed all houses in two communities. Residents in the most ash-affected communities have been evacuated to designated safe zones. Some 112 families (469 persons) from southern Ambae have sought refuge in 10 host communities in the east, whilst 757 families (3,055 persons) from the northern communities are temporarily sheltering in Saint Patrick’s College and Torgil Training Center in the northeast. An undetermined number have voluntarily relocated to Santo, Efate and other nearby islands. A state of emergency was in effect on the island of Ambae until 13 July as the activity of the Manaro Voui volcano remained unpredictable. On 7 June, the threat level of the Manaro Voui volcano is categorized as “major unrest state”, and was lowered from volcanic alert level three to level two; with the danger zone now limited to a 2 km radius from the active vent. Parts of Ambae Island have been blanketed with ash for weeks, and although volcanic activity has recently decreased, light ashfall continues to be experienced in some northern parts of the island. In previous weeks, the ashfall had increased the risk of landslides, two of which were triggered by heavy rain and destroyed all houses in two affected communities. Residents in the most ash-affected communities left their homes and evacuated to designated safe zones. Some 2,000 residents remain displaced on Ambae living with host communities or in evacuation centres on the island, whilst around 800 people are known to have voluntarily left Ambae relocating to Santo, Efate and other nearby islands. As of 10 July, the Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 2 due to its continued and major unrest state. Observations have confirmed that the volcanic activity has been unstable since 20 June. On 1 July, the volcano emitted a column of ash which induced heavy to light ash fall driven by the prevailing trade wind at villages from North-West to West of Ambae Island and the North-Eastern part of Santo Island. A small eruption scale in Lake Voui is continuing. On 16 July, much of the east and north of Vanuatu's Ambae Island experienced heavy ashfall after the eruption from the volcano intensified, residents said. A second state of emergency was declared by the Government of Vanuatu’s Council of Ministers (COM) from 26 July to 26 September 2018. In addition, an order was made to immediately evacuate all people in Ambae to nearby Maewo island. As of 23 August, Ambae volcano remains in the minor eruption state at Volcanic Alert Level 3. The volcanic activity is likely to remain at the minor eruptive activity or decrease to a major level of unrest at any time. The Danger Zone for life safety is limited at 3 km radius from the active vent and areas located in the Yellow Zone. As of 21 September, Ambae volcano is in the major unrest state. The Volcanic Alert Level is lowered to Level 2. The Danger Zone for life safety is now limited at 2 km radius from the active vent and areas located in the Yellow Zone. Observations in September 2018 confirm that the eruptive activity occurred in July until August has dropped. There is no explosions and volcanic cloud emitted are white colour, means only steam. A small scale eruption in Lake Voui has ceased.\",\n",

According to the Nepal Police, 104 people were killed, 64 people have gone missing, and 73 people have been injured. In Kathmandu Valley alone, 37 people were killed by landslides and flash floods. At least 1,545 families are displaced. Security forces have been mobilized for ongoing search and rescue operations. The municipality, National Red Cross Society, and civil societies are responding to the affected population. Landslides have blocked many highways, and the roads reaching Kathmandu, the capital city are all blocked. The death toll and damage caused by heavy rain that has resulted in flooding and landslides in central and western Nepal is increasing. According to media, as of 30 September, at least 193 people died, including 34 in the capital Kathmandu, 31 are still missing, and 96 have been injured. In addition, three highways have been blocked by landslides isolating Kathmandu, and schools have been closed. According to media reports, as of 1 October, 217 people died, including 35 due to a landslide in Dhading district, in Bagmati province, southern Nepal. National authorities and Save the Children report that 111 people have been injured, 4,000 have been rescued, a total of 540 people have been displaced, and 5,000 have been affected. In addition, more than 54 schools and four bridges have been damaged, and 23 highways have been affected. The rainfall recorded on 26 and 27 September has been identified as the heaviest ever recorded in Nepal's history. One week after the onset of heavy rainfall in Nepal, more than 81,000 people are estimated to be affected by floods and landslides. It is estimated that more than 230 people, including 55 children (20 girls and 35 boys) have died, with many others injured or reported missing. An estimated 4,667 houses are fully destroyed while 5,310 houses are partially damaged. Landslides and rubble have blocked major roads into the Katmandu Valley, hampering access to goods and critical services, including healthcare. Reports of increase in food prices and other essential items in the valley have begun. Access to critical services is affected, with 62 health facilities, 550 water supply systems, and 9,000 sanitation facilities damaged. UNICEF is concerned about possible disease outbreaks, including cholera and dengue fever. More than 190 schools have been damaged, affecting 23,000 students. As of 03 October, 236 people have been killed, 173 injured, and 19 remain missing, while 17,120 have been rescued. The estimated damage includes NPR 4.35 billion to energy infrastructure, NPR 2.5 billion to roads and bridges, and over NPR 6 billion to agriculture. Hydropower projects, schools, health facilities, and communications have been severely affected across impacted areas. While the floodwater in affected areas is receding, the risk of communicable disease outbreaks is heightened, including waterborne (Acute Gastroenteritis, Cholera, Hepatitis-A/E), rodent-borne (Leptospirosis), vector-borne (Dengue, Malaria), and vaccine-preventable diseases (Tetanus, Measles). Overcrowding in displacement camps also raises concerns about COVID-19 and Influenza outbreaks, while health service disruptions may impact treatment for TB, HIV, and other diseases. The humanitarian impact has increased following widespread floods and landslides that have affected several parts of Nepal since 26 September. The Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal reports, as of 8 October, 246 fatalities, more than 200 due to landslides, 18 are still missing and 186 others have been injured. Moreover, more than 1,000 families have been affected and almost 1,500 houses have been damaged or destroyed. As of 16 October, the total number of deaths has reached 250 that includes 76 females, 114 males, and 60 children, with 18 individuals still missing and 178 reported injured. More than 17,000 people have been rescued through various rescue operations that deployed more than 30 thousand security personnel. The Nepal Government has declared 71 municipalities across 20 districts as disaster crisis/emergency zones due to the severe impacts of landslides and floods. As of 5 November 2024, the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) conducted a detailed assessment in 6 of the most affected and targeted districts namely, Kavre Palanchowk, Sindhuli, Lalitpur, Makwanpur, Ramechhhap and Panchthar in October 2024. The teams on the ground have reported more than 5,300 households (approximately 26,500 people) across these districts have been affected. Due to the severe impact of the floods and landslides, the affected families still do not have access to basic services like water, transportation, communication and electricity services have not been restored in some of the remote areas. According to the NRCS District Chapters, most of the displaced families are staying in the rented houses, few of them are still living under tarpaulin or with their relatives.\",\n",

Inadequate provision of basic services (especially water supply and disposal of solid waste); migration and population displacement from and to areas with dengue, increase the risk of transmission affecting the life and health of people in 18 departments of Peru. In late March 2017, The Ministry of Health personnel announced it would fumigate and thus prevent the spread of mosquito Aedes Aegypti that causes dengue. Throughout the emergency more than two thousand brigades have made 15 thousand medical consultations and of the 3,723 establishments in the zone 87% are operating and equipped. The Ministry of Health declared health emergencies in the departments of Tumbes, Piura and Lambayeque.

In 8 of the 11 regions declared in emergency, 19,318 cases of dengue have been reported, including 3 probable cases of Lima Region. Piura and Ica are the regions that report the highest number of cases, and 262 cases are added in Metropolitan Lima, an area that does not correspond to the declaration of emergency. Twenty-six deaths from dengue have been decreed, of which 16 (62%) correspond to the region of Piura. Dengue cases continue to increase and have already exceeded 44,000 cases. Piura, with 26,958 cases is the most affected department, accounting for 60 per cent of the total. On 25 July, UNICEF stated that The Ministry of Health (MINSA) has reported 67,294 cases of Dengue and 56 confirmed deaths attributable to the disease nationwide as of 1 July. Piura has the highest number of Dengue cases, with 33,134 probable and 9,919 confirmed cases. This is followed by La Libertad with 2,981 probable and 3,561 confirmed cases; Ica with 2,623 probable and 1,560 confirmed cases; and Tumbes with 3,413 probable and 424 confirmed cases. On 17 August, Peru's Executive Branch of the Government declared a 90-day sanitary emergency in the regions of Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Áncash and Ica, in order to guarantee public health service to prevent and strengthen the fight against dengue. As of 29 August, UNICEF states that even though the Ministry of Health (MINSA) is conducting many activities to prevent dengue and Zika transmission, the number of cases of dengue is much greater than reported in previous years for the same time period. MINSA has reported 71,517 cases of dengue and 65 confirmed deaths attributable to the disease nationwide as of 19 August. Piura has the highest number of dengue cases with 35,578 probable and 11,373 confirmed. Piura is followed by La Libertad with 2,496 probable and 4,323 confirmed cases; Tumbes with 3,764 probable and 588 confirmed cases; and Ica with 2,705 probable and 1,643 confirmed cases. Even though the Ministry of Health (MINSA) is engaging in many activities to prevent the spread of dengue and Zika, the transmission of dengue has been much higher than reported in previous years over a similar time period. As of September 2, according to MINSA’s 35th Report, there have been 71,775 cases of dengue and 80 confirmed deaths attributed to the illness throughout Peru. Piura has the highest number of cases of dengue with 47,257 confirmed cases, followed by La Libertad with 6,817 confirmed cases, Tumbes with 4,444 confirmed cases and Ica with 4,358 confirmed cases.\",\n",

       "   'disaster_description': \"Flood is the most severe of the hazards observed in Nepal in terms of physical and socioeconomic losses and destruction. Koshi, Karnali, and Narayani are the major river systems in Nepal, and floods from these large perennial river systems generally impact several districts in the Southern Terai plains. Moreover, rivers such as West Rapti, and Babai Rivers, which originate in the Mahabharat range, do more damage in the Terai floodplains because they frequently generate flash floods during the monsoon. Moreover, the Terai's vulnerable topography, combined with its dependency on agriculture, exacerbates the severity of flood hazards compared to other regions. The targeted flood-prone areas are the Terai districts along the flood plains of Karnali, Babai and West Rapti rivers, namely Banke, Bardiya and Kailali, frequently affected due to flooding in the monsoon period. People living along these rivers especially low-lying areas, informal settlements, fragile houses, and those who have low-income status and a number of dependent family members to care for, are highly vulnerable to flooding; especially during the monsoon (June to September). The monsoon season is impacting several parts of Nepal, causing floods, triggering landslides and resulting in casualties and damage. According to the Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal, as of 8 July, 21 people have died since the beginning of the month - 12 due to landslides and nine others to floods - three people are still missing, 29 have been injured and 541 families have been affected across several districts of the country. Heavy rainfall has been affecting central Nepal (particularly the Gandaki province and the neighbouring Bagmati province over the last 24 hours, triggering huge landslides that have resulted in casualties and damage. Media report, as of 12 July, 11 fatalities across the Kaski district (Gandaki province), one fatality and 65 persons still missing in the Chitwan district (Bagmati province) due to different landslide events. Over the next 96 hours, very heavy rainfall is still forecast over most of Nepal. In the past few days, a series of landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rainfall have occurred in parts of Nepal and resulted in casualties and damage. In particular, in Chitwan District, south-central Nepal, a major landslide swept away two passenger buses, leading to eight fatalities and 54 still missing people as reported by the Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal (DRR) and media. According to the DRR portal, since 10 July, a total of 25 people died and 13 others have been injured in five different landslide events across the districts of Baglung, Chitawan, Kaski, and Myagdi. With the onset of monsoon rainfall in various parts of Nepal, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs, 143 people died and 47 people went missing as of data dated 30th July 2024 due to disasters such as floods and landslides in various places. 22 people died in Koshi province, 6 people died in Madhesh province, 31 people died in Bagmati province due to floods and landslides. According to the ministry, 42 people died in Gandaki province, 24 people in Lumbini, 8 people in Karnali and 10 people in Sudurpaschim province. During the period, more than 3,779 households were displaced from their homes by the disaster. A glacial lake outburst occurred in the Koshi province (the easternmost province of Nepal) on 16 August, causing flash floods and mudslides that resulted in displacement and damage. Media report, as of 19 August, 135 displaced people, 93 rescued people, 20 destroyed houses, one destroyed school and one destroyed health facility across the area of the Thame village (Solukhumbu district, Koshi province).\",\n",

UNICEF’s Cholera Task Force is fully operational, and measures are being taken to enhance water, sanitation, and hygiene – over 100,000 liters of sewage were collected from UN House POC on 18 July. As of 17 November, communities along the River Nile are worst affected and account for 91 per cent of reported cholera cases. A total of 2,874 cases and all 44 deaths from the outbreak have been reported from eight counties straddling the River Nile: Awerial, Duk, Fangak, Juba, Leer, Pageri, Pigi and Terekeka. Rubkona is the only county affected by the outbreak that is not along the Nile. Juba has the highest number of cases (1,990 - 63 per cent of the total), while Terekeka has the highest case fatality rate. As of 5 May 2017, cholera outbreaks have been confirmed in 19 counties in South Sudan. The most affected counties are located along the River Nile. This suggests vehicle-borne transmission from contaminated water in affected counties. Cumulatively, 7,735 cholera cases, including 246 deaths (76 facilities and 170 community) (CFR 3.23%), have been reported in South Sudan since the initial case was reported on 18 June 2016. Nine out of 19 counties ever affected since June 2016 are considered to have active transmission, having reported cholera cases in the past four weeks. Cholera transmission has continued to decline countrywide. In the last four weeks [weeks 37-40], cholera cases dropped from at least 40 cases in week 37 of 2017 to at least 15 cases in week 40 of 2017. Three counties [Juba, Budi, and Fangak] have registered cholera transmission in the last four weeks [37-40]. A total of 135 cases have been reported from the three counties in the last four weeks [37-40]. Most of the cases have been reported from Juba [112 cases] while Budi and Fangak reported 16 cases and 7 cases respectively. As part of the ongoing cholera response, health partners have deployed cholera vaccines to complement traditional prevention strategies in several high-risk populations and locations. This is the latest step in ongoing efforts to end South Sudan’s longest and deadliest cholera outbreak. South Sudan declared the end of its longest and largest cholera outbreak on Wednesday (February 07), with no new cases of cholera reported in over seven weeks.',\n",

Tropical Storm Lisa was located near latitude 15.5 N, longitude 77.3 W or about 735 miles East by South of Belize City. Lisa was moving to the West at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and a minimum central pressure of 1003 mb. The system is forecasted to continue on a general west to west-north-westward track for the next few days with landfall possible on Belize late on Wednesday 2 November night or early Thursday 3 November in the morning. Lisa is expected to strengthen with the potential to make landfall as a category 1 hurricane on Belize. At 12:00 pm on 31 October 2022 the National Hydrological Service released Flood Bulletin No. 1 for Tropical Storm Lisa indicating areas expected to increase to flood stages across the entire country affecting main rivers. At 1:00 pm on 31 October 2022, the Prime Minister of Belize in his capacity as the Chairman of NEMO declared a hurricane watch (RED – 1) for the entire coast of Belize with landfall likely within 36 to 48 hours. On 2nd November 2022, hurricane Lisa made landfall just south of Belize City as a category 1 storm. The NEMO estimated close to 39 percent affectation rate of the country’s population i.e. approximately 172,000 persons. At the time of the submission of the Initial Situation Assessment (ISA), there were no reported fatalities associated with the storm’s passage. The storm has resulted, however, in the temporary displacement of a large number of persons, with an estimated 5K+ seeking refuge in state managed shelters across the country of Belize. The ISA reports damages primarily to the housing sector which is reflective of the poor housing stock associated with the areas of affectation. An estimated 500 houses have been reported as being completely destroyed, with an additional 5,000 homes suffering from light, medium and heavy damages. The NEMO reports initial damage estimates to the housing sector as being approximately USD$10M with most of this damage recorded within the Belize District.',\n",

Most confirmed cases, approximately 71.5%, have occurred among children aged 2–14 years. Between week 19, 2022 and week 31, 2023, 4 160 suspected cases of diphtheria were reported from 27 states in Nigeria. Kano (3 233), Yobe (477), and Katsina (132) States have reported the most cases. A total of 137 deaths were recorded among confirmed cases (CFR 7.5%). Of suspected cases, 1 534 were confirmed, including 87 laboratory confirmed, 158 epidemiologically linked, and 1 289 clinically compatible. With low national vaccination coverage and a worldwide shortage of lifesaving antitoxin threatening to worsen the outbreak, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) urges the international community to immediately scale up support to improve treatment, preventive measures and contact tracing to control the outbreak’s spread. “We’re currently seeing more than 700 people with suspected diphtheria and admitting more than 280 patients on a weekly basis in Kano state’s two diphtheria treatment centres,” says Dr Hashim Juma Omar, MSF emergency project medical doctor. “Women and children aged under five are the most vulnerable groups and are the people most affected right now in Kano state. And they really need help.” The outbreak has reached alarming proportions, with 32 states affected, and 12 states experiencing severe cases. Kano State reports the highest number of new infections, with Yobe state also facing a serious situation, resulting in the tragic loss of 117 children, according to the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency. Between week 19 of 2022 and week 6 of 2024, a total of 27 078 suspected cases of diphtheria were reported from 36 states in Nigeria. Among these cases, 16 603 were confirmed, comprising 365 laboratory-confirmed, 483 epidemiologically linked, and 15 755 clinically compatible cases. From week 1 to week 8 of 2024, 417 suspected diphtheria cases and 16 deaths (CFR 3.8%) were reported in the BAY States in 23/65 LGA (Adamawa 2 cases, 0 deaths; Borno 271 cases, 14 deaths; Yobe 144 cases, 2 deaths). Between weeks 1 and 10 of 2024, a total of 4 178 diphtheria cases have been reported in Nigeria, including 2 009 confirmed cases and 30 deaths.',\n",

Of the total, 34 have already been confirmed to be due to the viral haemorrhagic fever, according to Nigeria’s Centre for Disease Control. The disease, which first broke out in November, has spread to 10 states. Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of the country, but more in some states than others particularly during the dry season. In Togo, two cases were reported in February 2016. The affected area in Togo borders with Benin. In Nigeria, as of 17 May 2016, 8 states are currently reporting Lassa fever cases (suspected, probable, and confirmed), deaths and/or following of contacts for the maximum 21-day incubation period. Currently, 248 contacts are being followed up in the country. The other 15 previously affected states have completed the 42-day period following last known possible transmission. Overall, the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows a declining trend. Considering the seasonal peaks in previous years, improvements in community and health care worker awareness, preparedness and general response activities, the risk of a larger-scale outbreak is low. On 25 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Benin notified WHO of an outbreak of Lassa fever. On 23 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Benin declared the end of the outbreak. The announcement came 42 days after the detection of the last Lassa fever case in the country. The current report confirms that, at present, there are no known Lassa fever transmission chains in Benin.',\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'A deep depression over southeast Bay of Bengal has intensified into a cyclonic storm \"Amphan\" on Saturday, 16 May. The cyclone is currently located in the central Bay of Bengal and will track north, north-eastward towards India and Bangladesh. The system is very likely to intensify further into a major tropical cyclone in the next 24 hours. According to the latest forecasts, the cyclone will make a landfall on 20 May somewhere in NE India, West Bengal – Bangladesh coast. It is expected that it will bring strong winds, very rough sea conditions, storm surge and heavy rain across Odisha and west Bengal coasts. The Indian Meteorological Department has issued an orange alert for this region. A red alert has been issued for Gangetic West Bengal, which urges residents to take action to protect themselves from extremely heavy rainfall and severe winds. Bangladesh Meteorological Department has issued a Special Weather Bulletin and a warning alert as well. The Government of Odisha has identified 567 cyclone shelters, as well as 7,000 community buildings to relocate around 1.1 million people across 649 villages along the seacoast. The community based COVID-19 quarantine centres in coastal areas are being shifted to safe locations. The State and the National Disaster Management forces are in readiness. The Communities Working Group in Cox’s Bazar works on community level awareness in all 34 camps. As of 22 May, a satellite detected inundated areas around Kolkata, West Bengal, India. An International Water Management Institute map shows the inundation extent covering the city of Kolkata after the Super cyclone landfall on 20 May at 5:00 PM. The ESA Sentinel-1 image acquired on 22 May 00:04 which is a cloud-penetrating satellite showing partial inundation (Orange) in the urban areas to large-extent and complete inundation in agricultural areas (pink) and permanent water (blue) which are severely damaged by Cyclone impacting the infrastructure and crop damages. Thailand: A warning is in effect for high waves, flash floods and landslides in 14 southern provinces from 18-20 May as a result of Tropical Cyclone Amphan. Tropical storms have already damaged 1,305 homes in 11 upper provinces in northern, northeastern, central and eastern regions of the country. As of 19 May, tropical Cyclone AMPHAN has intensified into a super cyclonic storm as it continues north over the central Bay of Bengal, toward India\\'s Odisha and West Bengal States and Bangladesh\\'s Barisal Division. AMPHAN is expected to continue towards the Odisha coast, slightly weakening before making landfall over southern West Bengal on the morning of 20 May with maximum sustained winds of 190-210 km/h. The Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) in Bangladesh estimates that up to 14.2 million people in coastal districts are likely to be affected, with nearly 1.4 million displaced and up to 600,000 houses damaged. Evacuation from high-risk areas is to begin today and is already underway in high-risk areas in India. Tropical Cyclone AMPHAN continues towards India\\'s Odisha and West Benagal States and southern Bangladesh\\'s Barisal Division. On 20 May at 0.00 UTC its centre was 195 km south-east of Bhubaneshwar City (Odisha), and 370 km south-southwest of Kolkata (West Bengal), with maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h. According to media reports, national authorities in India are evacuating 1.1 to 1.2 million people from Odisha and from West Bengal, 2 million in Bangladesh. AMPHAN should make landfall over southern West Bangal (approximately 50 km south of Haldia and 100 km south of Kolkata) on 20 May, with maximum sustained winds up to 160 km/h before weakening as it moves over eastern West Bengal and western and central Bangladesh on 20-21 May. A red alert for heavy rain and thunderstorms is in effect over West Bengal (India) and a storm surge and wind warnings over coastal districts of Bangladesh over the next 24 hours. As of 21 of May, cyclone Amphan has made a landfall and it is crossing the West Bengal- Bangladesh Coast east of Sagar Island. According to the latest special weather bulletin of the Met Department of Bangladesh issued around 7.30 p.m., the cyclone currently lies over the coastal West Bengal and Sundarban on the Bangladeshi coast after making a landfall around 4 p.m. in West Bengal. It is likely to move in a north-northeasterly direction further and complete crossing the coast within the next 3-4 hours. Maximum wind speed within 74 kilometres of the Cyclone centre is about 160 kilometre per hour (kmph) rising to 180 kmph in gusts/ squalls. TC AMPHAN made landfall between Digha (West Bengal) and Hatiya Islands (Bangladesh) on Wednesday 20 May as category 3 storm (Saffir-Simpson scale) bringing strong winds up to 185 km/h and heavy rain, damaging houses, crops and cutting power supplies to cities and towns already struggling to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. At least 14 people have been reported killed in India and 7 in Bangladesh. More than three million people have been evacuated to emergency shelters. After landfall TC AMPHAN was downgraded to a tropical depression, but is expected to bring heavy to moderate rain over the next 24 hours in the northeast Indian states, West Bengal and Sikkim, as well as in most of Bangladesh, including in the Rohingya refugees camps. According to UNICEF\\'s reporting, the storm has put many people at risk, not only as a direct effect of floods and wind damage, but also given the potential spread of COVID-19 in crowded evacuation shelters. At least 77 deaths in India and 25 in Bangladesh have been reported so far. Over three million people in both countries continue to remain in community shelters. Significant damage has been reported in thatched houses, standing crops, horticulture, fisheries, power and telecommunication facilities in cyclone-affected areas. Most areas remained without electricity and communication network and blocked roads limiting a rapid response. In Cox\\'s Bazar, flooding and small landslides have caused damage to 300 shelters, blocked drains and damaged stairs, latrines and bridges. In India, Odisha and West Bengal states were affected, with nearly 60 million people affected and at least 80 people killed in West Bengal alone. More than 700,000 people were evacuated across India and at least 80,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. In Bangladesh, 10 million people were affected by Cyclone Amphan and at least 25 people were killed. An estimated 2.4 million people were evacuated ahead of the storm. According to preliminary reports, 330,000 houses were damaged, including 55,600 destroyed in the nine most affected districts. The cyclone led to the internal displacement of at least 100,000 people who are currently staying on embankments and with friends or relatives. Satkhira, Khulna, Barguna, and Patuakhali districts were most severely affected, with up to 1.2 million people highly affected in those four districts alone. In Bangladesh, tropical cyclone Amphan has severely affected the livelihoods of at least 1 million people, destroyed houses and infrastructure, including irrigation facilities. According to initial Government estimates, the overall damage to housing, infrastructure, fisheries, livestock and crops was set at BDT 11 billion (USD 130 million). The most affected areas are located in the southwestern parts of the country, including the districts of Khulna, Jessore, Satkhira, Bagerha and Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhota and Noakhali. Although the path of the cyclone did not hit Cox’s Bazar, the effects of the cyclone nevertheless was felt in the refugee settlements in Cox’s Bazar, which received heavy rain and strong winds. The Bangladesh Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) raised three flags as an alert sign for refugees in the Cox’s Bazar refugee settlements. The three flag was the highest alert level that refugees have seen for a cyclone since many of them first arrived in Bangladesh in 2017. Over 1,252 shelters were partially damaged and 159 shelters completely destroyed, temporarily displacing 144 households. In total, close to 6,000 refugees were affected by the cyclone. According to the rapid assessment report conducted in June 2020 by Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), in West Bengal, India, 2.9 million houses were reported damaged. There was a need for supply of shelter kits, utensils, tarpaulins, lighting solutions for those who had fully or partially lost their houses. Heath facilities damaged in West Bengal by the cyclone included 563 primary health centres, 169 Block primary health centres and 5,142 sub-centres at the community level. The existing health systems were already overwhelmed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the damages due to the cyclone made this worse. The waterlogged areas with debris and other waste materials would accelerate the risk of water and vector-borne diseases. According to Need Assessment Working Group (NAWG) report dated 31 May, approximately 2.6 million people were affected, 205,368 houses were damaged, 55,767 houses were destroyed in the 19 affected districts in Bangladesh. Total 26 people lost their lives. In addition, 40,894 latrines; 18,235 water points; 32,037 hectares of crops and vegetable; 18,707 hector of fish cultivation area; 440 km of road and 76 km of embankment were damaged. Later in August, due to active monsoon conditions and lack of sustainable repair of embarkment, a strong tidal surge has given rise to the water levels of the Shibsa, Kapotakkho and Koyra in Khulna, rivers causing breaches in the protection embankments in the already disaster-stricken coastal district bordering the Bay of Bengal. Twelve villages in Koyra and Paikgachha upazila, which were already severely damaged by cyclone Amphan and tidal water, have once again been flooded by this tidal surge. Six months after the cyclone, villages in Satkhira, Khulna remain inundated as Water Development Board (WBD) yet to repair damaged embankments. As a result of broken embarkment, around 50,000 people have been severely affected in Koyra and Paikgachha upazilas under Khulna district. At least 15,000 people exposed to serious waterlogging issues. In Satkhira district, 375 acres of land inundated as Kholpetua River breaches embankment and flooding 250 acres of farmlands and fish enclosures in this low-lying villages due to Kopotakkho river embankment collapsed and waterlogged hundreds of families.',\n",

       "   'disaster_description': 'In the region, Euphrates & Tigris rivers are currently experiencing drought conditions, resulting in lower river flow, and affecting dam storage. The current season is the second driest in 40 years. Iraq is anticipating a serious drought this summer following a particularly dry winter and reduced river flow caused by upstream damming programs by riparian countries. Climate change has potential impacts on food security such as reduction in wheat production, decrease in surface water storage, drying of shallower wells due to insufficient groundwater recharge, and an increase in the cost of water. If the dry conditions continue, and the water reservoirs are not replenished, the population will face an acute water shortage for irrigation of the next cropping season. In Iraq, large swathes of farmland, fisheries, power production and drinking water sources have been depleted of water. In the Ninewa governorate, wheat production is expected to go down by 70 per cent because of the drought, while in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq production is expected to decrease by half. Some families in Anbar who have no access to river water are spending up to USD80 a month on water. Temperatures are hitting record highs; last year saw Baghdad’s highest temperature ever of 52 degrees Celsius. WFP’s assessments revealed that the 2021 rainfall season has been below average, particularly in the northern governorates and Kurdistan Region. This could impact the final yield of the two major crops; wheat and barley. WFP’s May surveys noted that 8 percent of people in Ninewa and Kirkuk governorates have insufficient food consumption, twice as many as the 4 percent national average. Similarly, 13.4 percent of people in Ninewa reported employing negative coping strategies – such as borrowing money or eating less food – above the 7.5 percent national average. As consistently reported by UN Iraq, drought and water scarcity are pressing concerns, and the marshlands of southern Iraq are among the worst affected areas. With annual evaporation varying from 2.5 to 3 meters, and starkly reduced riverine flows supplying the marshlands, the area covered by water has been substantially reduced. Moreover, increased salinity and mineral concentration directly impact human and animal health. Urgent action is required to address the lack of potable water and associated risks, including forced displacement.',\n",

Viet Nam Typhoon Agnes struck Viet Nam on 9 and 11 November causing damage to the Red River Delta and coastal provinces. Three days of rainfall, varying between 400 and 700mm, caused extensive flooding in Hanoi. Agnes caused at least 134 deaths and seriously affected around 650,000 people. At least 31,000 houses were completely destroyed and over 120,000 were flooded and damaged. Out of 198,000 hectares of rice paddies flooded, total crop losses occurred on 55,000 hectares. Crop losses also occurred on 6,310 hectares of maize, 8,652 sweet potatoes and 16,000 manioc. Some 400 schools and 230 nurseries were also destroyed.',\n",

Given the extent of the plague, it was estimated that the food security of about 13 million people (60 percent of the population) could be affected in the absence of large-scale locust control operations. To cope with this dire situation, in December 2012, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Madagascar and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations developed a Three-year Programme (2013–2016) in response to the locust plague. Donor response has been timely and positive. The first locust campaign was fully funded and successfully implemented. The specific objective of the campaign, aimed at halting the dynamics of the locust plague while protecting crops and pastures, was achieved. Following surveys carried out on more than 30 million ha, the locust populations in an area exceeding 1.2 million ha were controlled, without any incident affecting human health or the environment and without causing significant damage to the major rice baskets. In order to sustain the results achieved during the first campaign, it is essential to support the decline of the locust plague during the 2014/15 campaign and return, in 2016, to a locust recession situation (overall objective of the Three-year Programme), thus putting an end to the locust crises’ cycle and avoiding further deterioration of the significant food insecurity situation.',\n",

The North and North health districts are the ones more affected by this outbreak. According to the MoH, the cumulative number of malaria cases reported during the first 10 weeks of 2017 is 1,960,620 with 869 deaths, this is higher than the same period in 2016 (1,804,258 cases and 841 deaths). Since the beginning of this year, more than 2.2 million cases and 1,000 deaths have been reported. The preliminary results of the MIRA evaluation (March 2017) indicate that malaria is one of the main causes of death in 84% of the collines (hills) visited. The most affected provinces are Cankuzo, Muyinga, Karusi and Kirundo with an incidence rate of 100%. The malaria outbreak situation in Burundi continues unabated with intense transmission causing high morbidity and mortality. The disease trend has been increasing in the past 10 weeks. In week 25 (week ending 25 June 2017), 173,355 clinical cases of malaria including 102 deaths have been reported, compared to 170,048 cases and 61 deaths reported in week 24. Since the beginning of 2017, 4,376,804 cases including 1,996 deaths have been reported, as of 25 June 2017. Meanwhile, a total of 8,169,484 cases and 3,826 deaths were registered in 2016. While the entire country is reporting a high burden of malaria, the northern, central and eastern regions are most affected. Ten out of 18 provinces in the country have attained the epidemic threshold, namely Karusi, Gitega, Muyinga, Kirundo, Kayanza, Ngozi, Bubanza, Cankuzo, Cibitoke, and Ruyigi. The 10 provinces represent 63% of the population at risk. With an incidence rate of 51.9%, malaria has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Burundi. The outbreak of malaria in Burundi has shown marked improvement in the last weeks, though the overall situation remains serious. The incidence started declining after attaining the latest peak in week 26, during which 175,755 cases including 71 deaths were reported. In week 29 (week ending 23 July 2017), 131,566 clinical cases of malaria including 68 deaths were reported, compared to 152,137 cases with 68 deaths registered in week 28. These figures, however, are still much higher than last year, when 109,496 cases with 62 deaths were reported in week 28 of 2016. Since the beginning of 2017, a total of 4,864,976 clinical cases of malaria including 2,205 deaths have been registered across the country. While the entire country is reporting a high burden of malaria, the northern, central and eastern regions are most affected. Ten out of 18 provinces in the country are in epidemic phase, namely Karusi, Gitega, Muyinga, Kirundo, Kayanza, Ngozi, Bubanza, Cankuzo, Cibitoke and Ruyigi. The number of malaria cases is decreasing (6,891,291 cases with 3,017 deaths) dropping under the same time last year. Malaria cases usually increase by the end of the year due to the rainy season.
